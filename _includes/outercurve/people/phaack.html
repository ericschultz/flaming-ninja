<p>I work at GitHub and live in a constant state of paradox. This sentence is not true. I like flux. I recently worked at Microsoft helping to bring open source ideals into the product teams. I shipped several projects under an open source license, including one product that accepted external contributions. I still work on that project, NuGet, in my spare time. </p>
