The mission of the Outercurve Foundation is to enable the exchange of code and understanding among software companies and open source communities. We do this by providing a skilled team of open source advocates who provide what we call "foundation in a box" services. In practice, this means we provide the basic business building blocks open source projects need as they grow, from software IP management and project development governance, to enable and encourage organizations to develop software collaboratively in open source communities for faster results. Our experience working with Enterprise software companies has allowed us to develop demonstrated neutrality which allows us to support projects regardless of their license, technology base, or development process, and has helped us develop a cost effective alternative to starting your own non-profit. . We are committed to fostering industry growth by extending the benefits of neutrality, a liability firewall for contributors, and sharing our excellence at packaging open source IP.
