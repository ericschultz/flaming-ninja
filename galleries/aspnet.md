The ASP.NET Open Source Gallery's mission is to support ASP.NET open source projects and to develop features of ASP.NET with greater community involvement. The gallery will be a collaborative environment for ASP.NET open source projects and passionate developers who want to solve problems with innovative solutions.

In addition to sponsoring the Gallery, Microsoft has donated the ASP.NET Ajax Library as the first gallery project. The gallery is open to adding ASP.NET related projects from the community as well as additional projects from Microsoft.
