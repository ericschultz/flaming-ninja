<h2>Project Organization</h2>

<p>Outercurve projects are "collected" together into Galleries. Just as a museum has collections of art grouped within a theme, so too does the Foundation. Galleries are “sponsored” by companies that provide the foundation funding to invest in building out the collection within a specific gallery.</p>
