GADS Open Source (GADS/OS) software allows electric generating companies to collect and report validated GADS performance data and event data (including outage, derating, non-curtailing, and reserve shutdown events) in standard formats required by NERC GADS and all major ISOs and to calculate industry-standard performance measures.
