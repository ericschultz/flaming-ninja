The WiX tool set creates Windows Installer packages (.MSI, .MSM, .MSP, etc.) from XML source code. The tool set integrates seamlessly into typical developer processes via command-line tools and Visual Studio integration. The project also extends the Windows Installer to support install applications on IIS, SQL, and other Microsoft platforms.

The primary goal of the project is to promote best practices for installation packages on Windows.
