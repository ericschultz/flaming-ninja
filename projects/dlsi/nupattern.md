NuPattern (formerly VSPAT) is an evolution of popular Microsoft automation technologies, and a revolutionary new approach for building custom tooling that helps drives adoption of proven software development practices, architectures, patterns and technologies across communities/organizations.

NuPattern is an exciting new approach for IT experts and software delivery organizations/communities/individuals that wish to scale their own expertise and proven practices across their community.

The project was developed and incubated by members of the Microsoft field with their partners who specialize in re-delivering high-quality custom IT solutions across industry sectors. The new model-driven tool set and approach has proven to change the way individuals and organizations design, build and deploy their repeatable solutions, by capturing, incorporating and scaling-out their best practices, domain knowledge and expertise using automation. These tools ensure consistency and predictability, and increase supportability, maintainability and productivity in building solutions through the use of patterns, templates, re-use and contextual guidance.
