ConferenceXP integrates recent advances in high-performance audio, video, and network technologies to seamlessly connect multiple, distant participants in a rich, immersive environment for distance learning, remote meetings, and other remote collaboration. ConferenceXP provides an extensible foundation for interactive collaborative environments and serves as a research platform for designing and implementing distance learning and collaboration applications.

Through the ConferenceXP platform we are exploring how to make advanced collaboration, multi-institutional instruction, and distance learning a compelling, rich experience by assuming the availability of emerging and enabling technologies, such as high-bandwidth networks, high resolution displays, Tablet PCs, and the advanced features in the Windows platform.

The ConferenceXP research platform also includes a set of API’s that enable researchers and developers to create new distributed applications that take advantage of the underlying collaboration technology. It enables them to develop the collaborative tools and applications they need without having to build them from the ground up. By partnering with research organizations and universities, the ConferenceXP project combines the academic community’s expertise in the learning sciences with Microsoft expertise in technology.
