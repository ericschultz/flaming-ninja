The Data Curation for Excel project (DataUp) is designed to promote archiving, sharing, and publishing of tabular data initially among Earth, Environmental, Oceanographic, and Ecological Scientists. The tool comes in two form factors, an Excel add-in and a website that will easily integrate into scientific data management workflow.  The goal is to enable faster and more efficient research, thereby increasing the pace of scientific discovery.
