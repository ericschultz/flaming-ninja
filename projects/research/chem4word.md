Research articles today describe chemical reactions and entities in a variety of ways, from common (or brand-name) labels, to identifiers and shorthand notations, to chemical formulae, to two- (and three-) dimensional graphical images of molecular structure.

Unfortunately for authors, producing a report that describes chemical data becomes an exercise in typesetting and/or graphics manipulation, and cross- and re-referencing existing chemical entities in a report is labor intensive. The resulting text is usually interpretable by humans but significant amounts of chemical data are lost in the process, making it difficult to programmatically extract meaningful information from such reports.

The goal of the Chemistry Add-in for Word is to simplify the task of authoring a chemical document, and to do so in a way that produces a semantically meaningful document, facilitating downstream tasks such as publishers workflows, entity extraction, and semantic applications. The Chem4Word add-in achieves this through:

* Providing a built in dictionary of chemical structures
* Enabling online lookup of further structures through existing services like PubChem
* Facilitating the process of linking and embedding chemical structures inside a Word document
* Allowing the author to easily modify the chemical structure and views, and to change the inline representation of that structure
