.NET Bio is a language-neutral bioinformatics toolkit built as an extension to the Microsoft .NET Framework. .NET Bio includes parsers for common bioinformatics file formats; algorithms for manipulating DNA, RNA, and protein sequences; and connectors to biological web services, such as NCBI BLAST.

The .NET Bio project will enable researchers and scientists to share data and development methodologies to support a range of life sciences research projects. Bioinformatisticians can build upon the .NET foundation to extend and enhance this project.
