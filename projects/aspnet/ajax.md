The ASP.NET Ajax Library Beta enables you to build database-driven web applications that execute entirely in the web browser. The library supports client data access, client templates, and client data-binding. The library also contains the more than 40 controls (e.g. autocomplete, mask edit, etc.) that were originally released as part of the Ajax Control Toolkit.
