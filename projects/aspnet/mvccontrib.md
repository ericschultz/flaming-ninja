The ASP.NET MVC framework provides an implementation of the “Model – View – Controller” design pattern for ASP.NET. Since 2007, the ASP.NET MVC framework has been implemented as an open framework, enabling the possibility of open source development in conjunction with the framework. MVC Contrib is a community project that takes advantage of this openness to provide enhancements and alternative implementations to the ASP.NET MVC framework that are open source. Grounded in principles of test-driven development, MVC Contrib is especially useful to developers looking to develop and test UI elements on top of the ASP.NET MVC framework.
