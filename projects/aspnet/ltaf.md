The Lightweight Test Automation Framework for ASP.NET (LTAF) was developed and is currently used by the ASP.NET QA Team to automate regression tests for the product. It is designed to run within an ASP.NET application.

Tests can be written in any .NET Framework language. Tests use an API to manipulate and verify the DOM of the browser. LTAF supports running tests in Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Opera.  This new version of the framework contains a new BrowserEmulator feature that allows developers to run tests without any UI. It provides a better opportunity to developers to incorporate functional tests with the source code and integration processes: for example run LTAF tests from within unit test framework.
