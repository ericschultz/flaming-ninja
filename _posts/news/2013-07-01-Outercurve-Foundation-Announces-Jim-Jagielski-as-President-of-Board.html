title: Outercurve Foundation Announces Jim Jagielski as President of Board
---
<p><strong>BOSTON, Mass., July 2, 2013 &mdash; </strong>Outercurve Foundation, an open source software foundation, announced today that Jim Jagielski would be taking over as the President of the Board of Directors. </p>

<p>Jagielski&nbsp;is a driving force and developer within the open source community.&nbsp;He is best known as one of the developers and co-founders of the&nbsp;Apache Software Foundation and&nbsp;currently&nbsp;serves as a&nbsp;consulting software engineer for open source&nbsp;software company Red Hat. Jagielski's extensive IT background includes roles as the CTO for both&nbsp;Zend&nbsp;Technologies and Covalent Technologies,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the Chief Architect and Chief Open Source Officer for&nbsp;SpringSource.&nbsp;He is also an accomplished coder (in numerous languages) and frequent presenter/interviewee/consultant on Web and cloud-related topics. </p>
<p>Jagielski has had a longstanding presence on the Outercurve Board of Directors. He&rsquo;s served as Board Secretary since March of 2010. He takes over the role of President from Sam Ramji of Apigee, who held the position for the past three years. Jagielski will further strengthen the foundation's dialog with other open source luminaries in the same spirit of collaboration that Ramji pursued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My plans are to help make&nbsp;Outercurve&nbsp;one of the pre-eminent Open Source foundations,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Jagielski. &ldquo;We hope to be able to provide more guidance and help to a larger group of people, and to expand our presence at related conferences and summits.&ldquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am extremely excited to continue as a Director for Outercurve,&nbsp;and to accept the position as President,&rdquo;&nbsp;Jagielski&nbsp;said. &ldquo;I feel that&nbsp;Outercurve&nbsp;is not only ideally suited to be the central clearinghouse for Open Source governance and community expertise, but is also the only foundation which makes this a prime objective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The directors voted on the full slate of officers, including&nbsp;Tony Hey, of Microsoft Corp. as Vice President, Sam Ramji, of Apigee as Secretary, and Gianugo Rabellino, of Microsoft Open Technologies, Inc. as Treasurer.</p>
