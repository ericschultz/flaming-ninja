**Wakefield, Mass. - Sept. 18, 2013 -** Outercurve Foundation announced today Erynn Petersen as its interim Executive Director. The appointment follows the departure of Paula Hunter, who held the position previously. Petersen has held senior leadership positions at top companies. She's built strong ties with the open source software community and championed enterprise adoption throughout her career.

Petersen was selected because of her related experience with the open source community, and role as an early Outercurve sponsor. Her work with Outercurve and AOL led her to champion the cause of Outercurve Foundation - increasing collaboration between corporations and communities through code. She will work with Outercurve board members and Board President Jim Jagielski on the Foundation's fiscal plan and structure.

Petersen has developed platform and technical strategies at companies through her career at companies including Amazon, AOL, and Microsoft. She was a Senior Vice President of Paid Services Engineering and led open source evangelism at AOL. Her work there included the application of open source software and development methods as well as developer recruitment. She also established a program for delivering AOL projects into the open source community.

She has an active role in expanding the role of women in software development and open source contribution as a current board member of Girl Develop It.

"We thank outgoing Executive Director Paula Hunter for her years of leadership, dedication, as well as her significant contributions to the Foundation's growth, and successes in advancing project participation," said Outercurve Foundation board President Jim Jagielski. "We are very excited to welcome Erynn Petersen, a talented technologist and fierce open source advocate. We are fortunate to collaborate with an veteran industry executive who knows our value proposition well, and can help the board as the foundation continues to evolve."
