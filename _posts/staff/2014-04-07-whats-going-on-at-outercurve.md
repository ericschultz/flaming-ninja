title: What's going on at Outercurve
---
So- lots going on at Outercurve.

For starters, we all wish the .NET Foundation the very best of luck. Having a foundation focused squarely on the .NET Foundation, including projects such as the .NET Compiler Platform, lets the .NET team grow the open source ecosystem around its projects. For Outercurve the launch of .NET Foundation has the advantage of freeing up Outercurve  to focus on its broader mission of building understanding and collaboration in the broader OS community.

Microsoft is a big company supporting many projects, and this sometimes gets lost in the noise associated with releases from specific teams. Across open source alone, in addition to the .NET projects, it has team actively participating in not only its own but other companies' projects (such as Open Daylight, on which Microsoft collaborates with the Linux Foundation and contributions to the Open Compute Project, founded by Facebook). Scott Hanselman kicked off a project just last month to increase contributions to open source projects by rewarding more open source contributors through the MVP program. Within Outercurve, the Chronozoom project in particular reaches an audience that extends well beyond the developer tools that Microsoft is traditionally associated with within open source. There's now native support for Git source control within Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server.  Creating the .NET Foundation is one among many varied efforts being undertaken at Microsoft to better support the open source community at large.

We've watched for a while now as people as varied as random bloggers to Jeff Atwood  have pushed Microsoft to invest in building official support for open source projects in the .NET ecosystem. I have a vague recollection that Jeff personally offered an award a few years back for open source .NET projects. Seeing this support from Microsoft on .NET open source come to fruition in the form of the .NET Foundation is a good thing.

As for Outercurve we've been working for the last 6 months on what our next steps are as a third party open source foundation. We've been on the road speaking at places ranging from OSTT to SXSW to RPI (go Engineers!) to keynoting the SUNY Open Source Festival. We've started shifting our contributions beyond .NET and more broadly to projects such as VistA EHR Studies Program, and we're nearly ready to announce our new partners and programs.

We have a solid board comprised of folks who among them have launched, led and managed complex projects across many industries and partners, and we're looking forward to bringing this experience to bear in building further successes in the open source community at large.

It's a big, open world out there and we're looking forward to helping it continue to grow alongside our partner foundations.
