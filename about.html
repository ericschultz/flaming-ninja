<h4 id="mission">Mission</h4>
<p>The mission of the Outercurve Foundation is to enable the exchange of code and understanding among software companies and open source communities. In practice this means providing software IP management and project development governance to enable and encourage organizations to develop software collaboratively in open source communities for faster results.</p>
<h4 id="governance">Governance</h4>
<h5>The Basics</h5>
<p>The Outercurve Foundation is a 501c(6) non-profit organization governed by a Board of Directors that operates according to an approved set of <a href="{{BASE_PATH}}/assets/files/OutercurveFoundationBylaws-2010-10-28.pdf">bylaws</a>. The vision and policy of the foundation are determined by the Board, and any agreements entered into by the Foundation are approved by the Board. Corporate and Gallery Sponsors fund the Foundation. A board appointed Executive Director with a small staff oversees day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>In November 2010, as a result of amendments to our by-laws, the Outercurve Foundation announced the creation of membership classes and an expansion in the number of seats on our Board of Directors. In addition, provisions were made to establish a Technical Advisory Board (TAB). This Board will be populated by gallery managers, project leaders, and project committers. Members of the TAB will be eligible to serve on the Board of Directors after completing a one year term on the TAB. We anticipate holding elections for the first TAB slate later in 2011.</p>
<h5>The Details</h5>
<p>The Outercurve Foundation provides a framework to facilitate the participation of corporate software developers in open source projects, either through intellectual property contributions to the foundation or through time volunteered under the auspices of the foundation to enable development work on open source projects. The Outercurve Foundation also provides a channel of communication from the open source community back to Foundation sponsors and other software companies, advancing the dialog between software companies and open source communities.</p>

<p>To enable companies and individuals to make contributions to the foundation we have prepared the following documents to allow for both assignment and license of copyrights or patents to the foundation. Projects who wish to be a part of the foundation use these agreements as a starting point for making their contribution:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="{{BASE_PATH}}/assets/files/OutercurveFoundationBylaws-2010-10-28.pdf">Our by-laws</a>.These are the ground rules established by the Board of Directors for the operation of the foundation. On November 2010, the Board approved a series of amendments to the by-laws that facilitate the expansion of the Board, new membership and sponsorship categories, and provides indemnification to project committers.</li>
