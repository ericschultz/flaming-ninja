<p><strong>Outercurve Project:</strong>&nbsp;CoApp<br>
<strong>Idea:</strong>&nbsp;CoApp Package Maker GUI (Reference #2012-001)<br>
<strong>Mentor:</strong>&nbsp;Eric Schultz<br>
<strong>Backup Mentors:</strong>&nbsp;Andreas Schiffler (Experienced GSoC Mentor), Garrett Serack<br>
<strong>Idea Description:</strong>&nbsp;The CoApp project has a command line tool that allows a developer to create packages. We'd like to see a drag &amp; drop desktop application that would allow software publishers to create a package in a GUI, instead at the command line. This would be a great advantage for open source developers who wish to create packages, but are a little daunted by the script-based package creation.<br>
<strong>Difficulty:</strong>&nbsp;This project could be handled by an intermediate level developer with some GUI skills.</p>
<p><strong>Outercurve Project:</strong>&nbsp;CoApp<br>
<strong>Idea:</strong>&nbsp;Visual Studio plugin for CoApp packages (Reference #2012-002)<br>
<strong>Mentor:</strong>&nbsp;Eric Schultz<br>
<strong>Backup Mentors:</strong>&nbsp;Andreas Schiffler (Experienced GSoC Mentor), Garrett Serack<br>
<strong>Idea Description:</strong>&nbsp;Currently, CoApp developer packages can be installed and used from the command line. Ideally, developers would be able to use developer library packages directly from inside Visual Studio, using a dialog similar to 'add reference' in the solution explorer. This would greatly enhance the adoption of open source packages on Windows, as leveraging them would be very trivial.<br>
<strong>Difficulty:</strong>&nbsp;This project could be handled by an intermediate-to-strong level developer with some GUI skills, and a familiarity with Visual Studio.</p>
<p><strong>Outercurve Project:</strong>&nbsp;CoApp<br>
<strong>Idea:</strong>&nbsp;CoApp ptk Build Automation tool (Reference #2012-003)<br>
<strong>Mentor:</strong>&nbsp;Garrett Serack<br>
<strong>Backup Mentors:</strong>&nbsp;Andreas Schiffler (Experienced GSoC Mentor), Eric Schultz<br>
<strong>Idea Description:</strong>&nbsp;The CoApp project has a command line build automation tool (ptk.exe) that is used to automate in a consistent manner any existing build system (make, cmake, msbuild, etc...) The current version of this extremely critical tool has been thrown together as one hack upon another, and really needs to be rewritten from the spec up, which would allow us to implement new features that are difficult to add in the current version.<br>
<strong>Difficulty:</strong>&nbsp;This project could be handled by an entry-to-intermediate level developer, that has a good grasp of the fundamentals of building software in scripts.</p>
<p><strong>Outercurve Project:</strong>&nbsp;NuGet<br>
<strong>Idea:</strong>&nbsp;Improving NuGet on Mono (Reference #2012-004)<br>
<strong>Mentor:</strong>&nbsp;Drew Miller<br>
<strong>Backup Mentors:</strong>&nbsp;Phil Haack<br>
<strong>Idea Description:</strong>&nbsp;The NuGet.Core.dll and NuGet.exe assemblies don't have any specific ties to Windows. Would be nice to make sure these libraries work on Mono and then double down with an add-in for MonoDevelop to install NuGet packages.<br>
<strong>Difficulty:</strong>&nbsp;Getting the libraries to run on Mono is entry-to-intermediate. Getting the add-in written is intermediate-to-advanced.</p>
<p><strong>Outercurve Project:</strong>&nbsp;NuGet<br>
<strong>Idea:</strong>&nbsp;Target capability filtering (Reference #2012-005)<br>
<strong>Mentor:</strong>&nbsp;Drew Miller<br>
<strong>Backup Mentors:</strong>&nbsp;Phil Haack<br>
<strong>Idea Description:</strong>&nbsp;Today, no matter what kind of project you're building, the NuGet add-in shows a list of all possible packages, not just the ones that match the type of project you're building. This project would entail working on both the client and server to support better filtering of packages making NuGet more useful.<br>
<strong>Difficulty:</strong>&nbsp;Intermediate to advanced</p>
<p><strong>Outercurve Project:</strong>&nbsp;NuGet<br>
<strong>Idea:</strong>&nbsp;Improve Assembly Strong Name Behavior (Reference #2012-006)<br>
<strong>Mentor:</strong>&nbsp;Drew Miller&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Backup Mentors:</strong>&nbsp;Phil Haack<br>
<strong>Idea Description:</strong>&nbsp;Strong named assemblies cause a lot of pain for developers. We'd like to disallow strong named assemblies by default and require a flag when creating a package to force a strong named package for those who really need it. See the discussion here: http://nuget.codeplex.com/discussions/247827<br>
<strong>Difficulty:</strong>&nbsp;Intermediate.</p>
<p><strong>Outercurve Project:</strong>&nbsp;NuGet<br>
<strong>Idea:</strong>&nbsp;Complementary VSIX signing (Reference #2012-007)<br>
<strong>Mentor:</strong>&nbsp;Drew Miller<br>
<strong>Backup Mentors:</strong>&nbsp;Phil Haack<br>
<strong>Idea Description:</strong>&nbsp;Some runtime libraries have associated tooling that make the library more useful. For example, when installing a Markdown library, you may also want a Visual Studio Extension for Markdown syntax highlighting. This feature would allow packages to list optional related software to install. When installing the NuGet package, the list of related packages will be displayed in a notifier unobtrusively. When the user clicks the notifier, they'll have the option to install some or all of the related software.<br>
<strong>Difficulty:</strong>&nbsp;Intermediate.</p>
<p><strong>Outercurve Project:</strong>&nbsp;Mayhem<br>
<strong>Idea:</strong>&nbsp;Mayhem AddOn Gallery (Reference #2012-008)<br>
<strong>Mentor:</strong>&nbsp;Eli White<br>
<strong>Backup Mentor:</strong>&nbsp;Will Beebe<br>
<strong>Idea Description:</strong>&nbsp;Currently, Mayhem has a very rudimentary repository for new AddOns - event and reaction modules that extend the power of Mayhem. Unfortunately, the repository is manually generated, and does not provide proper tools for developers to submit their apps, and for the community to review them. In addition, as the collection grows, it will need to have some form of organization, and clear ways to search both official documentation as well as a knowledge base of how people have used Mayhem for particular applications. The goal of this project will be to create appropriate tools and add features to the AddOn Gallery to address these deficiencies.&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Difficulty:</strong>&nbsp;Medium</p>
<p><strong>Outercurve Project:</strong>&nbsp;Mayhem<br>
<strong>Idea:</strong>&nbsp;Module Testing Framework (Reference #2012-009)<br>
<strong>Mentor:</strong>&nbsp;Eli White<br>
<strong>Backup Mentor:</strong>&nbsp;Will Beebe<br>
<strong>Idea Description:</strong>&nbsp;When developers put forth modules to be published on the AddOn Gallery, we have to review the code by hand, making sure there is nothing malicious, and then testing them to make sure they follow our standards. It would be great to have a testing framework that could help automate this process.<br>
<strong>Difficulty:</strong>&nbsp;Medium – Hard</p>
<p><strong>Outercurve Project:</strong>&nbsp;Mayhem<br>
<strong>Idea:</strong>&nbsp;Unit Tests (Reference #2012-010)<br>
<strong>Mentor:</strong>&nbsp;Eli White<br>
<strong>Backup Mentor:</strong>&nbsp;Will Beebe<br>
<strong>Idea Description:</strong>&nbsp;We currently have no automated tests for the main Mayhem application. We’d love to see some unit tests and functional tests to help us keep our code quality high!<br>
<strong>Difficulty:</strong>&nbsp;Medium</p>
<p><strong>Outercurve Project:</strong>&nbsp;Mayhem&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Idea:</strong>&nbsp;Mayhem Modules (Reference #2012-011)<br>
<strong>Mentor:</strong>&nbsp;Eli White&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Backup Mentor:</strong>&nbsp;Will Beebe&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Idea Description:</strong>&nbsp;The motto for Mayhem is "connecting everything to everything else". While we will never achieve this goal, we do wish to extend the universe of devices and services which can be connected through Mayhem. The goal of this project is to build AddOns which add significant, new capabilities to Mayhem. Ideally, these AddOns will be simple to use, but broad and powerful in their application. This project requires considerable creativity. &nbsp;We're looking for students to propose modules to us to consider as GSoC projects.&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Difficulty:</strong>&nbsp;Easy - Hard</p>
