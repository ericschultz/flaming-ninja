<p>The Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is the program Google developed around 2005 to encourage students to get involved in developing open source software. It is designed to give students real-world practice with real software, to learn about open source software in the broader community, and to pay them for their work. More about the program can be learned at the <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012" target="blank">Google Summer of Code</a> website.</p>
<p> The Outercurve Foundation is once again applying to be a mentorship organization for GSoC 2013. We have been gathering all of the project ideas together for Outercurve sponsored projects. To submit an idea, send email to <a href="mailto:gsoc-students@outercurve.org" target="blank">gsoc-students@outercurve.org</a> or join the conversation on the <a href="/Overview/Forum/aft/2" target="blank">Outercurve forums</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: THIS IS FOR IDEAS ONLY. THIS IS NOT HOW OR WHERE STUDENTS APPLY. </p>
<p>Each idea should include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>The Outercurve Project name</li>
    <li>A title for the idea (We will assign the reference number)</li>
    <li>The name of a mentor for the student doing the work, if you're an Outercurve project leader/mentor.</li>
    <li>The name of a suggested back-up mentor if you're an Outercurve project leader/mentor. (Life happens.)</li>
    <li>Give a brief description of the idea. Remember, it needs to be understandable to someone reading it that may not be familiar with the project or familiar with your background.</li>
    <li>Give a sense of how hard the project might be. (Beginner but loves to code? Intermediate? Grad student rock star?)</li>
</ul>
<h3>For Students Applying</h3>
<p>If Outercurve is accepted as a GSOC organization, students can begin applying on April 22. Further information will be available here closer to the application period.</p>
