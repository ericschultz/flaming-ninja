<p>A public, documented governance model is a necessary component of a vibrant open source community. Transparent project governance builds trust among the project community and encourages deeper participation of community members. Knowledge of how decisions are made in a project provides members with more confidence that decisions are being made in the best interest of the project. Even more importantly, members who know how to influence this decision making are empowered by knowing they have control over the project's direction.</p>

<p>Outercurve has created a set of templates for projects interested in creating their own governance documents. These templates are a starting point for community discussions. Projects should modify these models to create a document that best fits their unique community.</p>

<h1>Key Components of a Governance Model</h1>

<p>A governance document is the contract for the project community. A governance document should contain the following:</p><ul><li> <b>Clear delineation of project roles</b> that a community member fit into and specific privileges and responsibilities for those in each role. Roles should include:
<ul><li>Users â€“ the project is meaningless without users. They are part of the community which means they should have clear roles in the governance of the project.</li><li>Contributors including which contributors must sign a CLA or assignment agreement with Outercurve</li><li>Committers</li><li>A first point of contact for Outercurve staff, sometimes called a Project Leader</li><li>Any other roles that are appropriate for the project community<br></li></ul><br></li><li><b>How a community member moves from one role to another</b> for all roles. For example, how a community member moves from being a user to a contributor.<br><br></li><li><b>A decision making system for integrating patches</b> that is clear and transparent.<br><br></li><li><b>Method of making decisions that affect the community as a whole</b> such as strategic direction or a change of the governance system. This will often include some sort of committee or board. (This "board member" role should be included as a community member role.)<br><br></li><li><b>Require that decision making be done in an open, transparent and auditable fashion.</b><br><br></li><li><b>Express the importance of broad community involvement in decision making. </b><br><br></li><li><b>Formal description of election process (as needed)</b></li></ul>
