<h1 class="separator">Introduction</h1>Some communities may value a more democratic process for deciding on Project Management Committee membership instead of appointment. In such cases, elections for PMC seats can be held. This template is based upon the Orchard community's election system.
<h1 class="separator">Pros and Cons</h1><b>Pros:</b>
<ul><li>Nullify bias in appointments: sometimes appointments to the PMC can be influenced by bias. While usually unintended, certain interests can receive disproportionate influence on the PMC. By giving most community members authority over the membership of the PMC, this bias can be reduced. Additionally, providing guaranteed representation on the PMC for sub-communities can reduce the bias further.<br></li></ul><br><b>Cons:</b>
<ul><li>Can create divisiveness in the community: elections can encourage community members to identify with groups of like-minded individuals in the community instead of as part of the community as a whole. Similar to political parties, this can have a negative effect on community cohesion and discourage necessary compromise.<br></li></ul><br><h1 class="separator">Template</h1><h2 class="separator">Elections</h2>Elections for the &lt;project&gt; PMC will occur during &lt;month&gt; every year.
