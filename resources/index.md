#Archiving an Outercurve Project
The Outercurve Foundation supports free and open source software projects and communities to help them evolve and grow. Occasionally, a project and its community run its course. Interest in the project may have waned or the technology may have matured to a stable point and require no further advancement. At such times, it is appropriate to work with the project's gallery manager and project leadership to [move the project to the Outercurve Project Archive](/resources/archive_project.html). 

#Marketing Resources

#Project Governance Information
Outercurve has [created a set of templates](/resources/governance/) for projects interested in creating their own governance documents. These templates are a starting point for community discussions. Projects should modify these models to create a document that best fits their unique community.
