I am so pleased to welcome the Facebook C# SDK project to the <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=94&tabid=87&mid=431">Outercurve DLSI gallery</a> - another great project that follows hot on the heels of the December launch of the <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=129&tabid=87&mid=431">OData Library for Objective-C </a>project.  <br />
<br />
<p>Given the tremendous influence of Facebook in almost every aspect of modern life, this is really exciting. Neither Facebook nor C# need any introduction, so the only thing I have to say is that I canâ€™t wait to see what great Facebook applications will be developed by the millions of C# developers out there. </p>
I would also add the usual call to action: spread the word and start writing apps using this SDK!
