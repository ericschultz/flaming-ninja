<p>I would like to welcome the <a href="/Galleries/ASPNETOpenSourceGallery/Nearforums">NearForums</a> project to the <a href="/Galleries/ASPNETOpenSourceGallery">ASP.NET Gallery</a> at the Outercurve Foundation. Nearforums is a lightweight modern discussion forum developed in C# with ASP.NET MVC. It runs on both Windows and Linux server infrastructures. Nearforums includes great features like the ability to sign-in with Facebook/Twitter, navigation via tags, full Web administration, RSS feeds, accessible HTML. It's also SEO friendly.</p><br /><p>I asked NearForums project leader Jorge Bay Gondra why he started the NearForums project and why license it as open source. Here's what he says:<br /><blockquote><em><br />I started Nearforums because I needed a forum engine for a website I own, and there wasnÂ´t any product with a permissive license that matched the features I required, and the technology (ASP.NET MVC). I wanted to make it open source to benefit from the community input and to produce something that could be reused and enhanced in the future.</em></blockquote><br /><p>I also asked Jorge to tell us why he brought NearForums to the Outercurve Foundation, and what he hoped he will be able to accomplish with the Foundation.<br /><blockquote><em><br />I first learned about the Foundation from the Orchard CMS project. I've learned that having the project inside Outercurve does not constrain it to any technology, project methodology or governance. Our main goal is to make the NearForums project grow and make a product that people and companies can rely on. To ensure that inside the project, we wanted to have as much input and as many collaborators as we possibly can. There are many open source projects out there that have strong dependency on the person who found it and we wanted to avoid that. I hope bringing the project to Outercurve will help us build a great community project!</em></blockquote><br /><p>Welcome, Jorge!</p>
