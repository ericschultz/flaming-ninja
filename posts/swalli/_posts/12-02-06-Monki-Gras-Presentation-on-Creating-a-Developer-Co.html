<p>I attended <a href="http://monkigras.com/">Monki Gras</a> last week. One presentation stood out with respect to Outercurve Foundation projects and developing community. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a> talked about his experiences building developer communities in the Jenkins community. </p> <p>There were several key observations: <ul> <li>Every developer starts as a visitor to your project site. Some of them <b>may</b> become users. Some of those <b>may</b> become your next wave of developers.</li> <li>Make everything relentlessly easy to do (from download, to use, to source downloads, builds and testing).</li> <li>User support is a great way to convert users into developers. Find ways to push source code in front of them. </li> <li>Modularity is key to allow easy contributions, because collaboration on the same piece of code is hard.</li> </ul></p> <p>His talk was wonderful. His examples seem so obvious, but he had equally brilliant counter examples (e.g. how hard it is to download Glassfish, slides 10-13). His <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/kohsuke/building-developer-community">slides are available</a> on SlideShare, and I would encourage all gallery managers, project leaders, and committers have a read. </p> <p>Lastly, I wrote a longer <a href="http://stephesblog.blogs.com/my_weblog/2012/02/open-source-software-development-futures-and-monki-gras-2012.html">description of the conference</a> overall on my personal blog.</p><br /><p><em>Update [15 Feb 2012]: I have also written on Network World about <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/three-views-creating-open-source-developer-communities">three perspectives on the care and feeding of development communities</a> based on three talks from Monk Gras, including Kohsuke's talk.</em></p> <br /><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephenrwalli/6828791919/" title="@kohsukekawa by stephenrwalli, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6828791919_af5f2bc893.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Photo: Kohsuke Kawaguchi presenting at Monki Gras"></a></p>
