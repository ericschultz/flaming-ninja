<p>In April, we welcomed the <a href="/Galleries/ASPNETOpenSourceGallery/LTAF">Lightweight Test Automation Framework</a> (LTAF)  project to the <a href="/galleries/aspnet/">ASP.NET Gallery</a> at the Outercurve Foundation. LTAF was developed and is currently used by the ASP.NET QA Team to automate regression tests for the product. It is designed to run within an ASP.NET application.<br />
<br />
Tests can be written in any .NET Framework language. Tests use an API to manipulate and verify the DOM of the browser. LTAF supports running tests in Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Opera.&nbsp; This new version of the framework contains a new BrowserEmulator feature that allows developers to run tests without any UI. It provides a better opportunity to developers to incorporate functional tests with the source code and integration processes: for example run LTAF tests from within unit test framework.</p>
<p>I asked LTAF project leader <a class="ApplyClass" href="mailto:antonpis@microsoft.com">Anton Piskunov</a> why they chose to release LTAF under an open source license.&nbsp; He replied: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We believe that involving a community of people who like and use LTAF will increase the number of ideas and enhancements we can develop cooperatively.&nbsp; ASP.Net developers may implement features that they need at any point and get them into the released version faster.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anton also describes what makes LTAF different and why it's needed:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <em>Compared to other automation frameworks LTAF is very lightweight, but still a powerful framework.&nbsp; It's also browser independent.&nbsp; It is very easy to add new tests, and inject them into automated workflows.&nbsp; It is possible to run LTAF tests from console apps, msbuild, unit tests, etc.&nbsp; LTAF includes a command line utility, LTAF Runner, that simplifies executing tests from the command line.&nbsp; LTAF was designed for running tests specifically for ASP.NET web sites and it would be handy for ASP.NET developers to have a free and easy to use tool like LTAF in their toolset.</em></p>
