<p>We&rsquo;re only a few weeks away from the first <a href="http://www.regonline.com/builder/site/Default.aspx?EventID=1224520">Outercurve Open Source Software Conference</a> (May 8-9, 2013 in Bellevue, WA).&nbsp; I&rsquo;m really excited about our speaker list!&nbsp; The conference will get underway with <strong>Jono Bacon</strong>&rsquo;s keynote on "Taking Your Community Across the Chasm".&nbsp; Jono runs the Ubuntu community, is the author of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.artofcommunityonline.org/">The Art of Community</a>&rdquo;, and organizes the the Community Leadership Summit each year before O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s OSCON in July.&nbsp; <strong>Donnie Berkholz</strong> will be presenting how &ldquo;A**holes are Ruining your Community&rdquo;.&nbsp; Donnie has been a leader in the Gentoo community for sometime, as well as being one of the core analysts at <a href="http://redmonk.com/dberkholz/">Redmonk</a>.&nbsp; We also have <strong>Ross Gardler</strong> talking about open source governance models. Ross now works for Microsoft Open Technologies, but Ross has years of experience with the Apache Software Foundation and spent a long time at <a href="http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/">OSS Watch</a>.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s also an Outercurve mentor. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Two speakers will provide context for the creation of the Outercurve Foundation.&nbsp; Microsoft corporate vice-president, <strong>Scott Guthrie</strong>, will talk about how his division works with Outercurve, its importance, and lead a Q&amp;A.&nbsp; <strong>Sam Ramji</strong>, Outercurve board president, and the person that set the Outercurve Foundation in motion will also provide a view of Outercurve and where it&rsquo;s going. &nbsp;</p>
We also have a set of Outercurve project leaders sharing what they&rsquo;ve learned in building some of Outercurve&rsquo;s larger communities with <strong>Bertrand Le Roy</strong> talking about the <a href="http://www.orchardproject.net/">Orchard Project</a>, and <strong>Phil Haack</strong> talking about the <a href="http://nuget.codeplex.com/">NuGet community</a>.&nbsp; We will be putting <strong>Garrett Serack</strong> (<a href="http://coapp.org/index.html">CoApp</a>), <strong>Rob Mensching</strong> (<a href="http://wixtoolset.org/">WiX</a>), and <strong>Jeff Handley</strong> (NuGet) up on stage as well for Outercurve Fight Club to demonstrate what a little creative disagreement looks like in a battle of the Outercurve package installation projects.&nbsp; Lastly, I&rsquo;ll be introducing a framework for how to think about organizing an open source software community for growth and success. &nbsp;
<p>After the presentations, if you want to roll up your sleeves and code, Garrett Serack will be hosting a 2-day hackathon on Friday and Saturday over on the Microsoft campus. &nbsp; We are bringing together folks from different Outercurve open source projects like NuGet, CoApp, and Orchard along with engineers from some Microsoft product groups. &nbsp; Prizes, drinks, and a whole lot of code! &nbsp; You can register for this event via the <a href="http://www.regonline.com/builder/site/Default.aspx?EventID=1224520">OuterConf registration process</a>.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s lots to see.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s lots to learn.&nbsp; (And we&rsquo;re still working on a last couple of speakers.)&nbsp; Please come out and join us for the first Outercurve Open Source Software Conference.&nbsp; </p>
