<p>We&rsquo;re only a few days away from <a href="http://www.regonline.com/builder/site/Default.aspx?EventID=1224520">OuterConf 2013</a>, the first Outercurve Open Source Software Conference (May 8-9, 2013 in Bellevue, WA).&nbsp; Our final speaker list has come together.&nbsp; We've added <a href="https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a> talking about the creation of the Jenkins community.&nbsp; This is an excellent <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/kohsuke/building-developer-community">expanded talk</a> on how to build on-ramps in community.&nbsp; This is in addition to keynotes from Jono Bacon, and Scott Guthrie, and presentations from Donnie Berkholz from Redmonk, Ross Gardler from Microsoft Open Technologies, and Sam Ramji (our Board President). A number of projects (<a href="http://nupattern.codeplex.com/">NuPattern</a>, <a href="http://www.chronozoomproject.org/#/t55">Chronozoom</a>, <a href="http://www.orchardproject.net/">Orchard</a>) will be giving demos of their latest features as well on the first day of the festivities. </p>
<p>As well, we have a great Wednesday evening planned at the Rock Bottom Brewery, and the Hackathon on Friday and Saturday May 10-11.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to seeing everyone there!</p>
