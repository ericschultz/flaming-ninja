<p>This week <a href="http://www.websitepanel.net/">WebsitePanel</a> joins the ASP.NET Gallery as the twelfth project at the Outercurve Foundation.  The ASP.NET Gallery continues to grow and flourish and it's great to see new projects continue to come on board.  WebsitePanel is a control panel for Windows hosting allowing one to manage all of one's web sites, FTP accounts, databases and other resources from a single place. It handles multiple servers, and supports a robust, scalable and secure architecture. </p>
<p>WebsitePanel started life as DotNetPanel, but a year ago, the project was re-written and released under an open source license as WebsitePanel.  The community continues to grow and the project <a href="http://www.websitepanel.net/works-with">works with</a> many different third party tools and projects. Welcome!</p>
