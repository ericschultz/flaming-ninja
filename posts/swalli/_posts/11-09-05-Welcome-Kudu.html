<p>This week <a href="https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu">Kudu</a> joins the ASP.NET Gallery as the fifteenth project at the Outercurve Foundation. The ASP.NET Gallery continues to grow and flourish sporting fully half the projects in the Foundation.  Kudu supports a set of browser-based functionality that includes viewing and managing a DVCS repository (git or Mercurial) hosted on a web server, editing and managing files in the browser, and building and deploying web applications.  It's a source code control browser written in C# and Javascript that supports continuous build functions.  </p>
<p>Come join the community!  Welcome, Kudu!</p>
