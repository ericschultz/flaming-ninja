<p>The Outercurve Foundation has been accepted as a mentoring organization in the 2012 <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a>.&nbsp; Google created the Summer of Code in 2005 as a global program that offers students stipends to write code for open source projects.&nbsp; Since then the program has brought together 6000 students and 3000 mentors to work on interesting OSS projects.&nbsp; As the Outercurve Foundation now supports on the order of 23 open source software projects, we thought it was high time we offered ourselves up as a mentoring organization.&nbsp; We hope to help mentor and support students getting involved in open source software through Outercurve projects such that they can learn about open source software broadly and improve their software development skills, while becoming long-term participants in projects that interest them. We hope our participation also lets people learn more about the Outercurve Foundation itself.</p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to the application deadline several Outercurve projects began submitting project ideas and mentors.&nbsp; We have collected these together on our projects <a href="/Overview/SummerofCode">Ideas Page</a>. &nbsp; We're still looking for YOUR ideas as a student, so please visit the Ideas Page to spark new ideas for submission.&nbsp; We're also looking for mentors.&nbsp; If you're interested in mentoring a student on one of the Outercurve projects, you can apply to be a mentor from the <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2012/outercurve">Outercurve organizational page</a> at the Google Summer of Code site itself.&nbsp; At the start of next week, students can begin to apply, so please keep your ideas coming in now.</p>
<p><em>Update: A really helpful page for understanding the Summer of Code and how to apply as a student is <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2012/faqs">the GSoC FAQ</a>. I also corrected the date for student applications to the start of next week. </em></p>
