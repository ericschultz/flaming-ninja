Foundations like the Apache Foundation or the Eclipse Foundation were built around projects that over time developed a way of building software and growing their communities.
People have long heard the expressions the "Apache Way" or the "Eclipse Way" associated with these projects. The Outercurve Foundation was created to help FOSS projects grow and evolve, and didn't come out of the growth of an existing project that reached a need for legal structure and business operations. This gives Outercurve a lot of freedom with respect to license choice, forge, and development management, but it also means there isn't an evolved culture that started from the original project work in community. There is no "Outercurve Way" per se.<br /><br />Outercurve presently supports 21 projects and has a growing pipeline. Projects come to us from a number of avenues. Some projects have been published under an FOSS license for some time and want to evolve their communities and involve corporate sponsors (e.g. <a href="/Galleries/DataLanguagesandSystemsInteroperability/GADS">GADS</a>).
Others have been freely available software for some time with thousands of downloads, and are now publishing the source under a FOSS license to build a developer community as
well as a strong user community (e.g. <a href="/Galleries/ResearchAccelerators/ChemistryAddinforWord">Chem4Word</a>).
Likewise our project leaders and committers come from a varied background with respect to open source.<br />
<br />The Foundation strongly believes in projects maintaining their freedom with respect to license choice, forge or venue, and developer management,
but we want to encourage a culture of successful community development, leadership, and project management. To this end we've begun a more formal Outercurve Mentorship program.
<br /><br />The program will bridge the gap over the next few years as Outercurve gallery managers develop their own expertise and experience within their galleries.
We've reached out to friends and colleagues in the broader FOSS community to people recognized for their community leadership skills. I'd like to welcome our first mentors on
board:<br /><ul><li>Phil Haack: Phil works at Github, has been a committer in the Outercurve world since working
  on <a href="/Galleries/ASPNETOpenSourceGallery/OrchardProject">Orchard</a> and runs the <a href="/Galleries/ASPNETOpenSourceGallery/NuGet">NuGet</a> project. </li>
  <li>Leslie Hawthorn: Leslie currently works as an Open Source Outreach Manager for Oregon State University’s Open Source Lab. She also serves as a Board Member/Advisor
    to the following organizations: the Humanitarian FOSS Project, the Open Source Business Resource and the Sahana Software Foundation. She previously worked as a
    Program Manager for Google’s Open Source Programs Office, where she was responsible for the company’s FOSS outreach efforts, most notably the Google Summer of Code program</li>
    <li>Taiwen (D.J.) Jiang: D.J. is the founder of the Xoops Engine, a BSD-licensed application development engine and was project leader for open source CMS XOOPS from 2006-2011.
      He also contributes to open source hardware projects as CTO for EEFOCUS who hosts the first and largest open source hardware community in China.</li>
      <li>Dave Neary: Active in the GNOME community, Dave has also worked on MeeGo, Maemo, OpenWengo and the GIMP since discovering Linux in 1996.</li>
      <li>John Mark Walker: John Mark first started in the open source world as a web developer at VA Linux Systems and eventually switched to the community team.
        Since then John Mark has worked as community manager at a number of startups, such as Groundwork, Hyperic and then Gluster (later acquired by Red Hat). In between,
        there was a brief interlude at IDG World Expo, where he was the conference director for LinuxWorld, GridWorld and OSBC.</li></ul>
        We're still talking with folks that are interested in participating as mentors for Outercurve projects and we hope to be expanding our bench over the coming weeks. If you're interested in participating or know someone that would make a great mentor, please <a href="mailto:swalli@outercurve.org">email me</a>. We're very excited about the program and look forward to people talking about the "Outercurve Way" in the years to come.<br />
