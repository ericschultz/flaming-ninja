<p>Through the Fall we began collecting and tuning the Outercurve Foundation development practices and guidelines for <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/About/DevelopmentPractices">publication on the web</a>. All our project managers and gallery managers contributed and vetted the practices. Several sources fed the process:</p> <ul> <li>Development guidelines from the early Microsoft-led <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/Galleries/ASPNETOpenSourceGallery/OrchardProject">Orchard Project</a> submitted by Bradley Millington (ASP.NET Gallery Manager and Orchard lead).</li> <li>Experience gained from other foundation efforts, so as to learn from other communities and not reinvent the wheel. (The <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/">Apache Software Foundation</a>, and <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources">Eclipse Foundation</a> have good resources).</li> <li>Experience with open source legal issues from our attorneys.</li> <li>Software product IP management experience with such large multi-source products as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyId=93FF2201-325E-487F-A398-EFDE5758C47F&displaylang=en">SUA</a> (née <a href="http://www.suacommunity.com/SUA.aspx">Interix</a>).</li> </ul>  </p> <p>As important as what is there is what’s not there.</p> <ul> <li>We are forge agnostic. Projects choose the tool sets that best match their needs. As such, we really aren’t too worried about which version control system a project uses, but rather that they rigorously use one. Aside from the fact that good configuration management is essential to good software development, it is also essential to good software IP management practice. So too with issue tracking systems.</li> <li>Project governance (as opposed to Foundation governance) is up to the projects. They need to support a transparent decision making process for the evolution of the project. They need to support a transparent process for deciding who becomes a committer on the project. Transparency is key to trust, but as we’ve seen in the diversity of Linux-as-Benevolent-Dictatorship and Apache-as-Well-Organized-Meritocracy, there isn’t one culture that needs be applied to ensure success.</li> </ul> </p><p>We have also re-organized and published the new project proposal process. Feedback is certainly welcome on all of it. We place a lot of value in the opinions of community members doing work in the community.</p> <p>Pax.</p>
