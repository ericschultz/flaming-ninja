<p>The <a href="/Galleries/ASPNETOpenSourceGallery/xUnitnet">xUnit.net testing framework</a> project has joined the Outercurve Foundation ASP.NET gallery.&nbsp; xUnit.net is a developer testing framework, built to support Test Driven Development. Its design goal is extreme simplicity and alignment with .NET Framework features.&nbsp; xUnit.net is compatible with .NET Framework 2.0 and later, and offers several test runners: the console, a GUI, MSBuild, and Visual Studio integration via TestDriven.net, CodeRush Test Runner and Resharper. xUnit.net also offers test project integration for ASP.NET MVC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project was created in 2007 and supports C#, F#, VB.NET and other .NET languages.&nbsp; Project leaders <a href="https://twitter.com/bradwilson">Brad Wilson</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesnewkirk">Jim Newkirk</a> are looking forward to growing the community of users and contributors under the auspices of the Outercurve Foundation.&nbsp; Brad and Jim are working on the next release of the software and xUnit.net 2.0 will take advantage of capabilities found in .NET 4.5, including asynchronous tests and testing in parallel.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Come check out the tool set, and join <a href="http://xunit.codeplex.com/">the community of users and developers working on xUnit.net</a>. Welcome! </p>
