<p><a href="http://www.outercurve.org/Galleries/InnovatorsGallery/Mayhem">Mayhem</a>, one of Outercurve&rsquo;s newest projects, is rapidly gaining traction in the developer community. &nbsp;Mayhem is an open source scripting engine for non-programmers which connects events with actions.&nbsp; An outstanding example of Mayhem in action will be showcased at this weekend&rsquo;s Bay Area <a href="http://makerfaire.com/">Maker Faire</a><a href="http://makerfaire.com/">,</a> scheduled for May 19-20 in San Mateo.&nbsp; In addition to the Mayhem team, Dave Templin and colleagues from SmartLabs will be showing a Mayhem-amped version of their <a href="http://www.insteon.net/Press120427.html">INSTEON</a> home automation technology. (SmartLabs has released the Mayhem software modules as <a href="http://insteon.codeplex.com/">open source</a> as well.) </p>
<p>INSTEON adds remote control and automation to lighting, appliance and home control applications of all types. It uses Mayhem&rsquo;s simple event-reaction scripting system as an interface to INSTEON components, enabling home-automation fans to interconnect services and devices to stir things up at home. Here are a few of the possibilities:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Control your pets: point an INSTEON motion sensor at the couch. When it detects your cat/dog/pet of choice jumping up, your computer can yell in your stead.</li>
    <li>Control your kids: see #1.</li>
    <li>Turn the lights on at home &ndash; from your office - using the Windows Phone module in conjunction with the INSTEON module.</li>
    <li>Left the coffeemaker or iron on when you went to work? No problem; turn them off. </li>
    <li>Act like a spy: set secret passwords to unlock the front door with voice commands.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an incentive for Mayhem fans, SmartLabs will be raffling INSTEON starter kits at the event. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget the Make Your Own Mayhem <a href="http://makemayhem.com/Contest">contest</a> &ndash; with Mayhem, you&rsquo;ll be able to dream up lots of your own home automation tasks &ndash; anything which can be coded with a simple action-reaction script.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in San Mateo this weekend, stop by Maker Faire and visit the Mayhem folks in the Microsoft booth.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
