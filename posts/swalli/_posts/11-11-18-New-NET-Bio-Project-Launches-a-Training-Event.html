<p><a href="http://bio.codeplex.com/">.NET Bio</a> is the latest project to join the Research Accelerators gallery at the Outercurve Foundation. It is a bioinformatics toolkit built using the Microsoft 4.0 .NET Framework to help developers, researchers, and scientists. This open-source platform is a library of commonly-used bioinformatics functions. Applications written to .NET Bio can be implemented in a variety of .NET languages, including C#, F#, Visual BasicÂ® .NET, and IronPython.</p> <p>The project team has recently released .NET Bio 1.0 and they are promoting it by offering a free 2-day workshop in Redmond on December 5th and 6th. You can see details and/or register for the course at this site: <a href="http://dotnetbio.eventbrite.com/">http://dotnetbio.eventbrite.com/</a>.</p>
