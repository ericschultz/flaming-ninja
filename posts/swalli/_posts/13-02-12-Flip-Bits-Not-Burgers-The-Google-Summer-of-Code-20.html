<p>Today Google announced the 2013 edition of <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/02/flip-bits-not-burgers-google-summer-of.html">the Google Summer of Code</a>. Google created the Summer of Code in 2005.&nbsp; It is designed to help students in several ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Inspire student developers to begin working with open source projects.</li>
    <li>Expose students to real-world development communities and situations.</li>
    <li>Give programming students the opportunity to do job-related work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last year, the Outercurve Foundation was honored to be chosen as a mentoring organization for its first time.&nbsp; We were awarded two slots and during the student proposal phase Outercurve mentors narrowed the candidates down to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Irina Grosu from the Faculty of Computer Science, Iasi, Romania with her submission to add modules to <a href="/Galleries/InnovatorsGallery/Mayhem">Outercurve Mayhem</a> to integrate Microsoft Office, the Google API, Bluetooth connectivity, and Skype.&nbsp;&nbsp; [The GSoC proposal is <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2012/irnuk/1">here</a>.]</li>
    <li>Cristina Turken from&nbsp; the Faculty of&nbsp;Electrical Engineering&nbsp;and Computer Science at Transilvania University of Brasov, Romania with her submission to create a GUI-based desktop application that allows software publishers to create a <a href="/Galleries/SystemsInfrastructureandIntegration/CoAppProject">Outercurve CoApp</a> package, (instead of using the command line tools). [The GSoC proposal is <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2012/cristina_sabre/1">here</a>.]</li>
</ul>
<p>We are going to apply again this year.&nbsp; I encourage all our Outercurve Foundation projects to consider participating.&nbsp; We will be starting the discussion with projects over the next couple of weeks.&nbsp; Likewise, if you're a student, please consider sending in a proposal for an Outercurve project.&nbsp; If you know a student, please encourage them to get involved in the Google Summer of Code.&nbsp; There's a great <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2013/help_page">FAQ for the Summer of Code</a> here.&nbsp;&nbsp; Watch this space over the next couple of weeks for more announcements.&nbsp; </p>
