<p>I have just returned from this year&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.openworldforum.org/en">Open World Forum (OWF)</a> and the <a href="http://eolevent.eu/en">European Opensource and Free Software Law Event (EOLE)</a> in Paris.&nbsp; The three day event remains a very well attended event anchoring the free and open source developer, legal, and business community in Europe each Fall.&nbsp; A number of talks are given in French, but this shouldn&rsquo;t deter people because for the keynotes and in the EOLE there was translation available.
</p>
<p>The market regulatory structure is different in the European Union from other parts of the world, and this bleeds through into many of the talks where EU procurement and open source success stories have a decidedly &ldquo;governmental&rdquo; flair.&nbsp; Often research funding comes from EU-based organizations as well.&nbsp; Likewise, in the EOLE event (which took place all day Friday) there was a lot of discussion that had to do with considerations of open source in a different sort of procurement climate.&nbsp; In this regard, OWF and EOLE sometimes feel more like the Government Open Source Conference (GOSCON) that Deb Bryant runs in the U.S. each year. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>I began Thursday attending Roberto Galoppini&rsquo;s &ldquo;Open Forges Summit&rdquo; <a href="http://robertogaloppini.net/2012/10/09/open-forges-summit-2012-11th-october-paris-owf/">collection of talks</a>.&nbsp; There were interesting and excellent discussions from a variety of perspectives.&nbsp; Ross Gardler (an Outercurve Foundation mentor) kicked discussions off from the perspective of forges &ldquo;simply&rdquo; being tools and not a substitute for community and process.&nbsp; Follow on presentations tackled the connection to App Stores, open source &ldquo;product&rdquo; discoverability, how forges can support communities (foundations, anyone?) and how corporate IT participants can engage with communities across forges. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Later in the day I attended the Community Summit discussions as they debated what&rsquo;s changed in the open source community space as cloud computing becomes more predominant.&nbsp; There were talks from Leslie Hawthorn (Red Hat), Lars Kurth (Citrix/Xen), Dave Neary (Red Hat), Simon Phipps (Open Source Initiative), Cedric Thomas (OW2), and Ross Turk (Ceph). &nbsp;
</p>
<p>I spent Friday with the lawyers in EOLE.&nbsp; Actually, in a similar fashion to the Open Source Business Conference (OSBC) Legal Track this past Spring, there was a good mix of business and development people in the room.&nbsp; I find this helps a lot, as lawyers learn how developers need to share code isn&rsquo;t simply driven by plagiarism so much as by the engineering economics of re-use.&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, developers and business people start to get a deeper understanding of how the law effects what they do.&nbsp; Bradley Kuhn (Software Freedom Conservancy) gave two good talks.&nbsp; In one he made the interesting point that while the free and open source software world went from fast-following in its early days to leading innovation for the cloud computing world, we are back in the space around software-as-a-service where once again the world is locked into proprietary systems (ironically built on free and open source software) and the world of free and open source software is finding itself again in the back seat.
</p>
<p>I shared the stage later in the day with Richard Fontana (Red Hat), who gave a good talk on considerations around contribution license agreements.&nbsp; My talk on the evolution of FOSS foundations followed.&nbsp; All of the talks are <a href="http://eolevent.eu/en/speeches2012">available online</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>All in all it was an excellent conference and I look forward to participating again in the future.</p>
