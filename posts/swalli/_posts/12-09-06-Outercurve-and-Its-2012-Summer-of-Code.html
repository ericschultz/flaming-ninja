<p>The Google Summer of Code 2012 (GSoC 2012) is coming to an end.&nbsp; Outercurve was <a href="/Blogs/EntryId/48/Outercurve-is-Participating-in-the-Google-Summer-of-Code">accepted as a mentoring organization for this year&rsquo;s Google Summer of Code</a>, being awarded two slots for student projects.&nbsp; Of the project proposals we received, a number of students stood out in debating and evolving their proposals with Outercurve mentors over the submission time.&nbsp; We accepted:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Irina Grosu from the Faculty of Computer Science, Iasi, Romania with her submission to add modules to <a href="/Galleries/InnovatorsGallery/Mayhem">Outercurve Mayhem</a> to integrate Microsoft Office, the Google API, Bluetooth connectivity, and Skype.&nbsp;&nbsp; [The GSoC proposal is <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2012/irnuk/1">here</a>.]</li>
    <li>Cristina Turken from&nbsp; the Faculty of&nbsp;Electrical Engineering&nbsp;and Computer Science at Transilvania University of Brasov, Romania with her submission to create a GUI-based desktop application that allows software publishers to create a <a href="/Galleries/SystemsInfrastructureandIntegration/CoAppProject">Outercurve CoApp</a> package, (instead of using the command line tools). [The GSoC proposal is <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2012/cristina_sabre/1">here</a>.]</li>
</ul>
<p>While we were very excited to participate in the Google Summer of Code, we had a problem.&nbsp; These were not the only two excellent proposals we received and discussed with students.&nbsp; The Outercurve Mayhem and Outercurve CoApp projects each wanted to support at least one more student proposal.&nbsp; The project leaders (finding budget at Microsoft) and Outercurve jointly funded two more student proposals.&nbsp; The two "Outercurve" Summer of Code projects accepted were:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Henrik Juvonen in his second year of computer science at the University of Turku in Finland wanted to build CoApp for Visual Studio so that CoApp library packages (native C/C++ and .NET) can be discovered, installed, and updated without ever having to leave the development environment. </li>
    <li>Anirudh Ranganath in his final undergrad year in engineering studying computer science in India wanted to add a number of events and responses to Mayhem for monitoring charging states, noting USB device connect/disconnect, and an Alarm event, as well as putting the computer in different power modes (sleep, hibernation, shut down) and setting the volume level.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the projects are wrapping up, final mentor reports are in, and final checks are being cut.&nbsp; Over the next few weeks we will showcase the students work.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to thank Google for the opportunity to participate, the project leaders for finding the funds to co-sponsor additional student projects, and our mentors (Garrett Serack, Eli White, Eric Schultz, Elizabeth Smith).&nbsp; I would especially like to thank our students for all their hard work.&nbsp; I hope they all found the summer worthwhile and will continue to participate with their Outercurve Foundation projects of choice. </p>
