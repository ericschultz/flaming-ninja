<p>The CodePlex Foundation today accepted the Orchard project into the  ASP.NET Open Source Gallery. The second project accepted by the gallery,  Orchard was contributed by Microsoft, the Foundation's launch sponsor.</p>
<p>Orchard, an open source, community-focused project, includes an  architecture and early-stage, reusable code components to help web  application developers build applications on the ASP.NET platform. The  initial focus of the Orchard project is to deliver a .NET-based, open  source CMS platform that will speed the development of content-driven  websites. Orchard's framework also will allow developers to provide  functionality through extensions and themes.</p>
<p>"The Orchard project is in its early stages," said Sam Ramji, interim  President, CodePlex Foundation. "We're very excited to accept it into  the Foundation's process because the open source community will be able  to play a significant role in shaping the direction in which the Orchard  project evolves."</p>
<p>The Orchard project is licensed under the OSI-approved New BSD  license. Miguel de Icaza, a member of the CodePlex Foundation's interim  Board of Directors, will serve as project mentor, with Bradley  Millington taking the role of project lead. Project sponsor Microsoft  has made a three-year resource commitment to Orchard, including a  full-time development team. The Orchard project is currently hosted on  CodePlex.com.
