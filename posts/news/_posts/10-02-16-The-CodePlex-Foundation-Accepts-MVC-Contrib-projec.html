<p>MVC Contrib, a community project led by Eric Hexter and Jeffrey   Palermo of Headspring, has been contributed to the CodePlex Foundation's   ASP.NET Open Source Gallery, it was announced today. Designed to add   functionality and ease-of-use to Microsoft's ASP.NET MVC Framework, MVC   Contrib is useful for developers looking to develop and test UI  elements  on top of the ASP.NET MVC framework.</p>
<p>MVC Contrib is the first project donated to the CodePlex Foundation   by an independent group of developers backed by an independent software   development company. Headspring, founded in 2001, is a custom software   development and consulting firm based in Austin, Texas. Headspring is a   Microsoft Gold Partner that specializes in delivering outsourced  custom  software and consulting.</p>
<p>"In accepting the MVC Contrib project, the CodePlex Foundation proves   the value of its legal and licensing innovations, in particular the   code contribution and assignment agreement," said Paula Hunter,   Executive Director, CodePlex Foundation. "Our legal documents and   processes reduce the risk and complexity for corporations that want to   contribute open source projects to the larger community. The Foundation   Is acting as a conduit between contributors, companies and the open   source community, solving the business issues of participating in open   source."</p>
<p>"We believe in the power of open source, and regularly share our code   with other developers," said Eric Hexter, Director of Open Source   Software Initiatives, Headspring. "By contributing the MVC Contrib   project to the CodePlex Foundation, we are stepping up to help bridge   the gap between corporations and the open source community. This   contribution serves as a great proof point of how corporate developers   and community projects can work together in open source to their mutual   benefit."</p>
