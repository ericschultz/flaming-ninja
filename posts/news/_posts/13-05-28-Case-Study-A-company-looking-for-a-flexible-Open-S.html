<blockquote>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: <a target="_blank" href="http://nwazet.com/">Nwazet </a>needed a Web site that it could easily customize and modify with the resources of a start-up. It chose the open source <a target="_blank" href="http://www.orchardproject.net/">Orchard platform</a>, because of Orchard&rsquo;s extensible architecture, and the company founder has been a member of the core Orchard development team from the start of the project.</p>

<br />
<strong>Challenges</strong>: Nwazet needed a flexible open-source commerce solution that would grow with the company and be easily modifiable to follow its rapidly evolving requirements. The team selected Orchard to better utilize its existing expertise and not waste time following the learning curve of a new tool. However, the commerce modules that were available at the time for Orchard were either too simplistic or were built on external platforms such as Amazon - some custom coding would be necessary.<br />
<br />
<strong>Results</strong>: Nwazet built its own open-source e-commerce module for Orchard, from the foundation of one of the simple modules that was available. Orchard enabled the company to fast-track the development, as a lot of what constitutes the concept of a product was already provided by the platform, such as titles, description, SEO, routes, and media management. It only had to add the commerce-specific elements: price, weight, etc. It then added Google Wallet support, as well as shipping, product attributes and discounts and is still constantly adding new features as required. This ultimately led to an assortment of e-commerce add-ons for Orchard. Several forks of the code have been created as other companies build solutions to their own specific requirements, and Nwazet has regular pull requests to integrate those into the main branch. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;We've been able to help our own business grow, as well as help other businesses and the Orchard community as a whole,&rdquo; said Bertrand Le Roy, founder and director of Creativity at Nwazet. &ldquo;The module has fostered its own mini-community around a viable, immediately useful, flexible and open-source e-commerce solution for Orchard.&rdquo;<br />
