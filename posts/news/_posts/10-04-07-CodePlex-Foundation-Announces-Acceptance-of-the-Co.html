<p><strong>Seattle, WA., April 7, 2010</strong> -- The CodePlex Foundation, a non-profit foundation formed with the mission of enabling the exchange of code and understanding among software companies and open source communities, today launched a new open source project called the Common Opensource Application Publishing Platform (CoApp) project in its recently-announced Systems Infrastructure and Integration Gallery. CoApp joins the Network Monitor Parsers project in CodePlex.org’s second gallery, which was formed to support projects that promote interoperability in heterogeneous computing environments that include Windows and open source technologies.<br />
<br />
Sponsored by Microsoft, the project has three committers and is being led by Garrett Serack from the Microsoft Open Source Technology Center. Still in a conceptual phase, the project intends to appeal to developers interested in committing time to building a development specification for CoApp and contributing to the project. The project url is <a href="http://www.coapp.org" target="_blank">www.coapp.org</a>.<br />
<br />
“Interoperability across the open source and Windows worlds is a worthy problem for the CodePlex Foundation to tackle,” said Paula Hunter, Executive Director, The CodePlex Foundation. “We are excited to bring CoApp into CodePlex.org as the second project focused on interoperability. The project promises to address the technical differences between Windows and open source application development practices to deliver constructive, useful tools for developers who are creating open source applications on Windows platforms.”<br />
<br />
“The CoApp project will involve the development of new tools, library repositories, management systems and guidance that will provide open source applications with support for features and benefits found only on the Windows platform,” said Serack. “I have already started conversations with several community developers who want to help build these tools and I hope it will appeal to many community and commercial developers.”<br />
