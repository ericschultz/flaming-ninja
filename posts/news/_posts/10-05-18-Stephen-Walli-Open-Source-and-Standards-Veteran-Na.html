<p><strong>Wakefield, MA, May 18, 2010</strong> -- The CodePlex Foundation, a non-profit foundation formed with the mission of enabling the exchange of code and understanding among software companies and open source communities, today announced the appointment of Stephen Walli to the position of Technical Director. <br />
<br />
Walli, whose open source career spans product management, business strategy, and open standards development, will manage the day-to-day operations of the Foundation’s galleries, collections of open source projects organized around a common theme or topic. In addition to coordinating project management with volunteer gallery managers and mentoring the Foundation’s project committers, Walli will develop and oversee software development practices and work with sponsors and external advisors to identify new projects and galleries.<br />
<br />
“Bringing Stephen on board as Technical Director is an important milestone for CodePlex.org,” said Paula Hunter, Executive Director, The CodePlex Foundation. “His credibility and connections in the open source community will accelerate our efforts with the many constituents in the open source world, as well as software companies and businesses that use open source but are unsure of how best to participate in the community.”<br />
<br />
“I’m excited to join the CodePlex Foundation,” said Stephen Walli. “I’m looking forward to working with the gallery managers and project committers, and to bringing new projects and galleries into the Foundation. It’s a tremendous opportunity to influence the rate of acceptance of open source in the commercial world.” <br />
<br />
Most recently a consultant on open source strategy, business development and standards, Walli previously served as VP of open source development strategy for Optaros. He was co-founder of Softway Systems, a venture backed startup that developed the Interix environment to re-host UNIX/Linux applications and a wealth of open source software on Windows NT. Softway was acquired by Microsoft in 1999. While at Microsoft, Stephen helped formulate Microsoft’s open source engagement strategy as a Business Development Manager for the Platforms team. A long-time participant in various ISO POSIX working groups, Walli is the author of Go Solo: How to Implement and Go Solo with the Single UNIX Specification and Migrating Applications to Open Platforms. <br />
