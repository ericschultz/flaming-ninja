Wakefield, MA. December 22, 2010 - The Outercurve Foundation today announced it has accepted the ConferenceXP project into its newly-established Research Accelerators Gallery. The project, a joint contribution from Microsoft Research and the University of Washington  Center for Collaborative Technologies, is an extensible e-learning and collaboration platform that integrates high-performance audio, video, and network technologies to seamlessly connect multiple, distant participants in a rich, immersive environment for distance conferencing, instruction, and collaboration. <br /><br />The ConferenceXP platform also serves as a research platform for designing and implementing distance learning and collaboration applications. ConferenceXP includes a set of APIs that enable researchers and developers to create new distributed applications that take advantage of underlying collaboration technology, enabling researchers to develop the collaborative tools and applications they need without having to build them from the ground up. <br /><br />ConferenceXP, initially conceived by the Microsoft Research Learning Science and Technology team, is under development at the University of Washington College of Computer Science & Engineering’s Center for Collaborative Technologies. <br /><br />"Academic institutions and researchers understand the benefits of e-learning and collaboration software, and have made significant progress advancing the technology," said Paula Hunter, Executive Director, Outercurve Foundation. "The assignment of the ConferenceXP project to the Outercurve Foundation will make this advanced learning and collaboration platform broadly available to the benefit of all in the research and open source communities.” <br /><br />The Outercurve Foundation has three galleries and nine projects. Galleries include the ASP.NET Open Source Gallery (five projects), the Systems Infrastructure and Integration Gallery (two projects) and the recently-announced Research Accelerators Gallery (two projects.) <br /><br />For more information on the Outercurve Foundation, visit www.outercurve.org.  <br />About The Outercurve Foundation<br /><br />The Outercurve Foundation is a not-for-profit foundation created as a forum in which open source communities and the software development community can come together with the shared goal of increasing participation in open source community projects.
