<p>Wakefield, MA. October 6, 2010 - The Outercurve Foundation today announced the acceptance of the NuPack project into the ASP.NET Open Source Gallery. The fifth project in the gallery, NuPack was jointly contributed by Microsoft, the foundation’s funding sponsor, and the independent developers of the Nubular (NU) project.<br /> <br /> NuPack is a free, open source developer-focused package management system for the .NET platform that will simplify the process of finding and incorporating third party libraries into .NET applications during development by automating the steps necessary to incorporating a package for the library, and its dependencies, into a project. <br /> <br /> NuPack also makes it easy for .NET developers to create and publish packages for other .NET developers to find and consume, enhancing the .NET ecosystem with a vibrant community of useful packages.<br /> <br /> “The NuPack project is significant because two groups of developers - one independent, one from Microsoft - discovered they were working to solve the same problem and decided to collaborate and contribute the combined project to the Foundation.” said Paula Hunter, Executive Director, The Outercurve Foundation. “The joint effort of the Nu Project development team and .NET developers within Microsoft shows cooperation at its best between the FOSS community and corporate developers.”<br /> <br /> For more information on NuPack or to contribute to the project please visit www.Outercurve.org or view the project page at http://nupack.codeplex.com/.<br /> <br /> About The Outercurve Foundation<br /> The Outercurve Foundation is a not-for-profit foundation created as a forum in which open source communities and the software development community can come together with the shared goal of increasing participation in open source community projects.
