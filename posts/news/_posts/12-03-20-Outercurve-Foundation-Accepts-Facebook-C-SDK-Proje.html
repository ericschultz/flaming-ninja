The Outercurve Foundation today announced it has accepted the Facebook C# SDK open source project into the Data, Language and Systems Interoperability (DLSI) Gallery. The project, a set of libraries which enables developers of Microsoft platforms to build applications which integrate with Facebook, was contributed to the foundation by project creator and architect Nathan Totten and co-committers Jim Zimmerman and Prabir Shrestha of Thuzi LLC.<br /><br />The Facebook C# SDK helps .Net developers build web, desktop, and phone applications that integrate with Facebook. Although not officially supported at this time the SDK works with Mono as well. The project was started as a set of libraries in April of 2010 by Totten while he was a partner at an independent software consulting firm. Totten later moved to Thuzi and was joined by project contributors Jim Zimmerman and Prabir Shrestha. Totten is now a Technical Evangelist at Microsoft.<br /><br />“As Facebook app developers, we realized early on that developing Facebook applications with C# would be much easier to do in a dynamic way since the Facebook API is dynamic by nature and changes a lot,” said Jim Zimmerman, Chief Technology Officer and Lead Developer for Thuzi LLC. “When I saw that Nathan was working on something similar to what I was working on at Thuzi, it seemed a natural fit to hire him and make something that we could use across all of our applications and products.” <br /><br />The Facebook C# SDK has had 10 major releases, and has been downloaded more than 140,000 times, proving to be one of the most popular community-driven open source projects in the .Net ecosystem. The project is hosted on github with developer discussions supported on Stack Overflow. <br /><br />“Providing .Net developers with an open source SDK that allows them to build applications which integrate with Facebook supports the Outercurve Foundation’s goal of increasing cross-platform interoperability,” said Paula Hunter, Executive Director, the Outercurve Foundation. “The project has great traction, an active community and numerous deployments on web and mobile apps. We’re very pleased to accept the contribution of the Facebook C# SDK project, and look forward to providing a supportive environment in which the project and its contributors will flourish.”<br /><br />For more information on the Facebook C# SDK project or the Data, Language and Systems Interoperability Gallery or the Outercurve Foundation please visit www.Outercurve.org.<br /><br />About The Outercurve Foundation<br />The Outercurve Foundation is a not-for-profit foundation providing software IP management and project development governance to enable and encourage organizations to develop software collaboratively in open source communities for faster results.
