<p><span style="font-family: segoe ui;">The Outercurve Foundation today announced acceptance of the Data Curation for Excel (DataUp) project into the Research Accelerators Gallery. DataUp facilitates scientific discovery by enhancing the tool used most by the scientific and academic community &mdash;Excel&mdash; to enable easy to use data sharing, search, manipulation and storage. DataUp was contributed by Microsoft Research. &nbsp;Key adopters include the University of California and the California Digital Library.</span></p>

<span style="font-family: segoe ui; font-size: 13px;"> </span>
<p><span style="font-family: segoe ui; font-size: 13px;">DataUp allows scientific data curation by enabling researchers to check and make Excel data files CSV compatible; apply metadata; generate citations, and post data files to DataONE repositories. DataUp meets the needs of scientists and researchers actively working with data used in environmental science. The project&rsquo;s contributors also are collecting suggestions and requirements from libraries, data centers, data managers, and other data professionals who use or house scientific data, including libraries and publishers.</span></p>

<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: segoe ui; font-size: 13px;">&ldquo;DataUp&rsquo;s primary goal is to facilitate archiving of tabular scientific data,&rdquo; said Derek Campbell, Gallery Manager, Research Accelerators Gallery. &ldquo;The tool comes in two form factors, an Excel add-in and a website, and easily integrates into scientific data management workflows. The goal of the project is to enable faster and more efficient research, thereby increasing the pace of scientific discovery.&rdquo; DataUp is distributed under the Apache 2.0 license. <br />
