<p>The CodePlex Foundation today announced the availability of the first  working draft of its <a href="CPF_Project_Acceptance_and_Operation-DRAFT.pdf">Project  Acceptance and Operation Guidelines</a>. The document, available on the  Foundation's website, describes the process for contributing open source  projects to the Foundation and outlines the organizational operation of  the Foundation in the project acceptance process.</p>
<p>Designed to accommodate the needs of corporate project sponsors,  individual project contributors, and project adopters, the Project  Acceptance and Operation Guidelines draft proposes an innovative gallery  sponsorship model that uses museums as a metaphor/design pattern for  how Foundation projects will be organized. This structure divides the  Foundation into Galleries - collections of thematically related projects  - which benefit from a common set of services provided by the  Foundation.</p>
<p>Galleries may be sponsored by a third-party organization, e.g. a  commercial software company, or run by the Foundation. They will rely on  Foundation staff and volunteers to provide a set of services through  the Foundation in support of Galleries.</p>
<p>The Project Acceptance Guidelines document builds on the Foundation's  mission and vision to set out two guiding principles by which the  Foundation can measure its success: commercial friendliness and  community viability. Community viability includes the objectives of  flexibility, teamwork, mentoring, user choice and best practices;  commercial friendly includes licensing, security and vulnerability  response, and gallery sponsorship.</p>
<p>The CodePlex Foundation is a not-for-profit foundation created as a  forum in which open source communities and the software development  community can come together with the shared goal of increasing  participation in open source community projects.
