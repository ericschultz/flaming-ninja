<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Russ Michaels is an employee of Blue Thunder Internet which is a small hosting company. Prior to using Website Panel, Blue Thunder Internet used Helm. When asked about looking for a new program to use, Russ said he had noticed that similar programs on the market that do support Windows have so many issues and problems; he didn&rsquo;t even want to go down that road again. Russ claims that Website Panel looked like the best bet because it was open source, adding that if they found themselves in a situation where the product didn&rsquo;t do something they wanted it to, they could at least pay someone to do it. There is that flexibility with WSP.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">While Russ does acknowledge that Website Panel was struggling on the support end, he realizes that there aren&rsquo;t a lot of developers who know hot o make the changes his company needed. However, it&rsquo;s only since Russ has been in touch with Omar that he has noticed Omar has taken charge and there has been a visible, big difference. According to Russ, Omar still does not have quite enough developers but it is a work in progress. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Omar&rsquo;s dedication to the project, Russ doubts that his company would have continue their use of the project.</p>
