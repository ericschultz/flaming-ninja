<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Omar Armenteros an employee of Virtuworks, in recent months has really stepped forward as the leading head of the open-source project Website Panel. The project had fallen to the wayside, however Omar refused to let a project he believed in dissolve. He has been described as a passionate leader who is drastically improving the project. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When asked why Omar uses Website Panel he described it as the best panel out there, it has design control and input into features and functions and last but certainly not least, it&rsquo;s free. He believes there is vast room for innovative thinking and growth with WSP, which is a perk not so easily available with commercial products. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Omar believes that in order for Website Panel to really take off it needs to be a community effort. Participants should contribute to the project, whether big or small in order to grow the project to the best of its abilities. Omar claims one of the biggest contributions could be organizing the community as well as making sure new members are fully aware and educated on how open-source projects work and run.</p>
