<p>A brief interview with Paul Long, Network Monitor Parsers and Network Monitor Experts<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is important about this project? Who benefits?</strong><br />
<br />
<em>Network protocol analysis is a broad subject which requires expertise for each domain that needs to be analyzed. By opening this up the community, we hope to use its expertise to make a better tool.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Which aspects of OSS are important to you - innovation? Cost reduction? Community and collaboration? The opportunity to guide development decisions? </strong><br />
<em><br />
Community and collaboration are the most important.<br />
</em><strong><br />
How often do you commit code to OSS projects in which you&rsquo;re involved? </strong></p>
<p><em>In the parser world, we have a group of developers to maintain and update the protocol parsers. We release a new version on a monthly schedule. For the experts, out team has updated two of our projects and added a 3rd. We have also received community involvement in one of the projects.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Tell us how you became an open source developer. Why?</strong><br />
<br />
<em>We wanted to harness the community expertise to help broaden our projects appeal. There is also a quicker agility in the open source world to fix issues and do updates.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have to developers new to open source?</strong><br />
<br />
<em>Investigate your options for open source as well as close source. Make sure you understand the impact and what open source means to you and your ability to plan and ship your project. There are both pluses and minuses that must be considered.</em><br />
