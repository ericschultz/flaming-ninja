<p><span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif;">Outercurve Foundation, an open source software foundation, announced today that project contributors are now receiving complimentary licenses for software development tools from JetBrains. The agreement broadens JetBrains&rsquo; goodwill toward the open source community. As a result, Outercurve project leaders have been reporting significant code quality and productivity gains that benefit open source software adopters and accelerate releases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif; color: windowtext;">The free licenses include JetBrains&rsquo; award-winning integrated development environments (IDEs), and the company&rsquo;s .NET and mobile development tools. </span><span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif; color: windowtext;">Outercurve</span><span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif; color: windowtext;"> project contributors may also use <strong>YouTrack</strong>, an agile project management tool, and <strong>TeamCity</strong>, a continuous integration and build management server. Those tools are available through CodeBetter, which is a collaboration of </span><a href="http://devlicio.us/"><span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif;">Devlicio.us</span></a><span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif; color: windowtext;">, </span><a href="http://ideavine.net/"><span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif;">IdeaVine</span></a><span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif; color: windowtext;"> and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/"><span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif;">JetBrains</span></a><span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif; color: windowtext;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif; color: windowtext;">&ldquo;We appreciate the free licenses of <strong>ReSharper</strong>. The code formatting tools and ability to convert code to LINQ expressions comes in handy,&rdquo; said Phil Haack, project leader of Outercurve&rsquo;s NuGet package management system. ReSharper is an add-on for Microsoft Visual Studio that offers .NET developers code inspections, automated code refactorings, enhanced navigation, and coding assistance.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif; color: windowtext;">&ldquo;The free hosted TeamCity environment that JetBrains and CodeBetter has offered Orchard and other open-source projects enables us to have a great and public automated continuous integration workflow,&rdquo; said Bertrand Le Roy, project leader of Orchard, an open source CMS for .NET. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif; color: windowtext;">&ldquo;Anybody can get daily builds, and we get release packages that we can directly release on CodePlex, from any changeset,&rdquo; Le Roy continued. &ldquo;JetBrains also generously offered licenses for ReSharper and <strong>dotTrace</strong> to core contributors, which help us keep Orchard fast and clean, and make development so much easier. These are fantastic products from true friends of open-source.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif; color: windowtext;">.NET authentication and&nbsp;identity management library DotNetOpenAuth has also realized substantial productivity gains from TeamCity. Project leader Andrew Arnott said: &ldquo;JetBrains' sponsorship of open source projects has allowed DotNetOpenAuth to consistently ship with higher quality, while its developers spend less time in full build validation and building special builds for early adopters.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif; color: windowtext;">&ldquo;Once we had TeamCity installed (which was pretty easy) we were able to check-in, and then just watch for emails over the next 20 minutes to see if something unexpected broke and then respond when it did. Building a final release of some version of DotNetOpenAuth is nearly fully automated with TeamCity as well,&rdquo; Arnott added.</span></p>
