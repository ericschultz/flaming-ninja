<p>A software code contribution agreement, new approaches to open source  licensing, a project acceptance process, a first technology gallery and  donated projects - these are among the early accomplishments of The  CodePlex Foundation, the open source foundation publicly launched with  support from Microsoft September 10, 2009.</p>
<p>Significant progress has been made against the Foundation's early  goals, according to interim President of the Board of Directors Sam  Ramji. "Our biggest accomplishment has been the development of a project  acceptance process which enabled us to accept a gallery donation and  also take on two projects," he said. "In addition, the Project  Acceptance Guidelines document released in October set forth very strong  guiding principles for the Foundation. A tremendous amount of work was  done in a very short time."</p>
<p>Also in progress are changes to the Board of Directors and continuing  evolution of the Board of Advisors, all with the intent of bolstering  the Foundation's independence and value to commercial software  companies, open source projects, and the open source community. "We are  very nearly ready to announce a permanent board of five members; three  are already in place, and final discussions are taking place with the  remaining candidates, who are well-known in the open source community,"  Ramji said. "Expect to see the full permanent board - with significant  changes to participants - announced in mid-January. We feel this is  solid progress on a very difficult task."</p>
<p>Recruitment of permanent staff also is well underway, with interviews  ongoing for Executive Director and Technical Director positions. "We  are seeing top candidates," said Ramji, "People with open source  backgrounds, experience in companies and non-profits, and deep ties to  the technical community are eager to join us to make the promise of the  Foundation reality - enabling the exchange of code and understanding  among software companies and open source communities."</p>
<p>Still to be addressed is the creation of a Foundation Charter, a task  Ramji and the interim board feel is best left to the  soon-to-be-announced permanent Board of Directors and permanent staff.</p>
<p>"The first 100 days have been an incredible ride," said Ramji. "We  have learned amazing things, received great advice from the Board of  Advisors and, informally, from experts in the worlds of OSS and open  standards. It's been a privilege to see people and companies inspired by  the Foundation's mission," he added. "Thinking about what we can build  with The CodePlex Foundation as we move ahead, I see more opportunity to  evolve our mission and to continue our legal innovations, making  membership in the Foundation more attractive for more corporate  sponsors, and proving our value to community projects."</p>
