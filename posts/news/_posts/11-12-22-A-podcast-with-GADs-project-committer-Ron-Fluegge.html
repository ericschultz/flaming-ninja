<p>We talked with Ron Fluegge, committer of the <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/Galleries/DataLanguagesandSystemsInteroperability/GADS">GADS </a>project in the DSLI Gallery....<br />
<br />
I wrote The GADS Project as a commercial application just over 25 years ago, and this is our best opportunity to make it as an open source project. We GPLv2 because it&rsquo;s the license we've seen grant the most freedom for the people who wanted to get access to the source code.<br />
<br />
GADS was written to allow small and large power generating companies to provide federally-mandated data to what's called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nerc.com/">The North American Electric Reliability Council. </a>GADS is a real benefit for those companies as an open source project, because they can all use it at minimal or no cost. <br />
<br />
When it came to finding a foundation to support GADS, everyone I contacted suggested Outercurve because it&rsquo;s an open source foundation that understands .NET projects.<br />
