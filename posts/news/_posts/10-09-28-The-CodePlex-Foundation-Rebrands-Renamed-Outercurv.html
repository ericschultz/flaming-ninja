Wakefield, MA, September 28, 2010 - The CodePlex Foundation, the open source foundation launched with support from Microsoft in 2009, today announced it has rebranded and adopted a new name: the Outercurve Foundation.<br /><br />The branding, undertaken to reduce confusion and differentiate the not for profit foundation from the Microsoft owned and operated forge CodePlex.com, comes a year after the foundation’s launch. In that time the foundation has developed a governance model, hired executive and technical management and elected an independent Board of Directors. Additionally the foundation created a project acceptance and management process that enables it to accept and support contributed open source projects - six projects have been accepted to date.<br /><br />The foundation groups related projects using a gallery metaphor and established two galleries in its first year, the ASP.NET Open Source Gallery and the Systems Infrastructure and Integration Gallery. The galleries house open source projects, ranging from libraries to speed ASP.NET development to package management systems to projects that analyze network protocol traffic in heterogeneous environments. <br /><br />“We accomplished a great deal in our first year and have been successful engaging with the FOSS community and corporate and independent developers,” said Paula Hunter, Executive Director, Outercurve Foundation. “The name ‘Outercurve Foundation’ speaks to our ambition to be a foundation on the leading edge of the open source world, representing the interests of the growing audience of developers and corporations engaging with the traditional FOSS community.”  <br /><br />“Open source development is becoming a mainstream IT strategy, but IT departments are looking for a model to turn that strategy into reality,” said Sam Ramji, President of the Board of Directors, Outercurve Foundation. “The foundation’s new name will increase recognition of its independence and reinforce its position as a participant and influencer in the FOSS and corporate development communities.” <br /><br />About The Outercurve Foundation<br /><br />The Outercurve Foundation is a not-for-profit foundation created as a forum in which open source communities and the software development community can come together with the shared goal of increasing participation in open source community projects.
