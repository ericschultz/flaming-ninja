<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Jess Coburn and Wayne Lansdowne are employees of Applied Innovations prior to using Website Panel had been using a commercial control panel. They decided to make the switch because they did not like the restrictions that come with commercial software because they were locked into its control structure. They were certain about making the switch to Website Panel claiming it was the best of both worlds. WSP is an open source community that adds new features and code and is up to date. While at the same time they are really able to personalize the control panel to their specific customer needs.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applied Innovations has contributed back to the Website Panel community, providing code and some bug fixes. They hope to continue contributing further to grow the project as they were concerned a few months ago because it was a little, &ldquo;iffy.&rdquo; However, there have been some changes and added functionality recently resulting in excitement moving forward. Jess and Wayne state the Website Panel has leveled the playing field for their company; they no longer have to wait for new releases from commercial software which is a pretty big deal for developers. </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jess and Wayne realize that Omar Armenteros has really brought the project back to life. Saying that the project just needed someone to champion it and he is really passionate about it, and that passion is contagious throughout the community. While Omar does have some really good developers, he still needs more. Jess and Wayne feel that the more outside vendors such as Microsoft or Smarter Tool that Omar can get involved with the project, the better it would be for the community as a whole. </p>
