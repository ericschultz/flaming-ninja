<p>A brief profile of Bertrand Le Roy, Orchard<br />
<br />
<strong>Tell us how you came to participate in this project?</strong><br />
<em><br />
I founded it with a few other people.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>What is important about this project? Who benefits?</strong><br />
<br />
<em>We wanted a modern CMS based on ASP.NET MVC. We also wanted an extremely extensible platform similar to what PHP has with Drupal. But most importantly we wanted to build better bridges between our team at Microsoft and the open-source community.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Which aspects of OSS are important to you - innovation? Cost reduction? Community and collaboration? The opportunity to guide development decisions? </strong></p>
<p><em>For me it&rsquo;s all about community. There is no reason to believe that all innovation should come from a single source. No matter how big Microsoft is (or maybe because it&rsquo;s so big), there is no way that it can produce as much innovation as the rest of the community. Open source is a very efficient way to build something like Orchard: our modular architecture makes it possible to build an ecosystem of innovation with a very low barrier to entry and very little centralized control. It&rsquo;s a collaborative model rather than a competitive one.</em></p>
<p><strong>What is your role/title in your parent organization? Are you on the IT side, or the product development side? </strong></p>
<p><em>To Microsoft, I&rsquo;m a Senior Program Manager in the ASP.NET team. To the Orchard community, I&rsquo;m the Benevolent Dictator.</em></p>
<p><strong>Is this your first open source project? </strong><br />
<em><br />
Oh gee, no. I have managed the Ajax Control Toolkit before that, and I have a myriad of small projects on CodePlex and other places. Some are Orchard modules, and some are independent libraries (such as FluentPath or Clay). In fact, everything I do has been open source for a few years now.</em></p>
<p><strong>How do you like to interact with your project team? Email, posting comments on wikis, Twitter?</strong></p>
<p><em>We try to have our discussions in the open, so that rules out e-mail for most things. We use a mix of CodePlex forums, Google groups, mailing lists, Stack Overflow and Trello.</em><br />
<strong><br />
</strong><strong>Tell us how you became an open source developer. Why?</strong><br />
<br />
<em>Because I believe in collaboration over competition.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>What advice do you have to developers new to open source?</strong><br />
<em><br />
Pick a project you like (Orchard is a good choice), and dive head first into the code. Try to understand its structure, spirit and flux. Subscribe to mailing lists. Start small, for example by answering questions on forums. If you don&rsquo;t know the answer to a question, investigate it: you&rsquo;ll learn something and you&rsquo;ll help someone. Pick-up approved bugs, and then submit patches for them. Grow your way into becoming a regular committer.&nbsp; If you need a problem solved in the platform you use, consider solving it yourself: be a contributor as much as a user.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Are there any cool/important projects out there you would like to plug (in addition to this one)?</strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Yes, I&rsquo;m very enthusiastic about open source hardware, which shows how crowd-based models of innovation can spread beyond software. My little contribution to this can be found here: http://www.pix6t4.com/</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Do you have a hobby or interest that you would like to share?</strong><br />
<br />
<em>Fiddling with electronics is a lot of fun, and a nice complement to the abstract activities of software development.</em></p>
<p><strong>Do you hold any software or technology patents?</strong><br />
<em><br />
Yes, but I stopped filing them from the moment I started working full-time for Orchard.</em></p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s your favorite technical magazine/blog?</strong><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Ars Technica</em><br />
