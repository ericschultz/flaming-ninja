<strong>Seattle, WA., May 4, 2010</strong> -- The CodePlex Foundation, a non-profit foundation formed with the mission of enabling the exchange of code and understanding among software companies and open source communities, today accepted a new open source project, the Web Forms MVP project, into the ASP.NET Open Source Gallery.<br />
<br />
The fourth project in the Microsoft-sponsored gallery, Web Forms MVP supports test-driven development for ASP.NET applications. A simple-to-implement Model View Presenter framework for ASP.Net Web Forms, the Web Forms MVP project balances productivity and control for developers charged with developing and maintaining ASP.NET applications by providing support for features such as data binding, normal server controls and asynchronous pages. Web Forms MVP is included in DotNetNuke version 5.3, a web CMS platform used to support large production web sites.<br />
<br />
Damian Edwards, a Microsoft employee, and Tatham Oddie, an independent software developer, contributed the project to CodePlex.org and are the project facilitators. The gallery manager is Dmitry Robsman.<br />
