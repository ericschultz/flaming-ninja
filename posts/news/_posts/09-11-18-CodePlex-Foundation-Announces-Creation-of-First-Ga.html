<p>The CodePlex Foundation today announced the creation of the first  Foundation project gallery, the ASP.NET Open Source Gallery, and the  acceptance of the first project into that gallery, the ASP.NET Ajax  Library project. The gallery and project were evaluated for acceptance  using the Foundation's <a href="CPF_Project_Acceptance_and_Operation-DRAFT.pdf">Project  Acceptance and Operation Guidelines</a>, first published October 21,  2009. The gallery and project are supported by Microsoft, the  Foundation's founding sponsor.</p>
<p>"Bringing the first project gallery and project into the CodePlex  Foundation shows significant progress against our 100 day goals," said  Sam Ramji, Interim President, CodePlex Foundation. "The ASP.NET Ajax  Library project is important for its great value to both the open source  and commercial software worlds, and the Foundation is the best forum in  which to shepherd its future development."</p>
<h3>Gallery and Projects</h3>
<p>The ASP.NET Ajax Library consolidates ASP.NET Ajax and the Ajax  Control Toolkit into a single open source project. The Ajax Control  Toolkit and Ajax Libraries, components of many web development  strategies, make it easy for developers to use the Ajax programming  model in their websites and web applications.</p>
<p>The ASP.NET Ajax Library project will be released under a BSD license  and can be used with many technologies, including, but not limited to  ASP.NET, PHP and Ruby on Rails. Future development of the project will  be done within the ASP.NET Open Source Gallery under the aegis of the  CodePlex Foundation.</p>
<h3>The CodePlex Foundation Gallery Model</h3>
<p>The CodePlex Foundation in October announced an innovative gallery  sponsorship model that uses museums as a design pattern. The  organizational structure divides the Foundation into galleries -  collections of thematically related projects - which benefit from a  common set of services provided by the Foundation.</p>
<p>Galleries may be sponsored by a third-party organization, e.g. a  commercial software company, or run by the Foundation. Galleries will  rely on Foundation staff and volunteers to provide a set of support  services, including administration, security, best practices and  marketing.</p>
<h3>About the CodePlex Foundation</h3>
<p>The CodePlex Foundation is a not-for-profit foundation created as a  forum in which open source communities and the software development  community can come together with the shared goal of increasing  participation in open source community projects.
