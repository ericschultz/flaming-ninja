The Outercurve Foundation today announced acceptance of the Visual Studio Pattern Automation Toolkit (VSPAT) project into the Data, Languages and Systems Interoperability Gallery. VPSAT, a toolset and framework for Visual Studio, enables IT experts to create and execute &lsquo;pattern toolkits&rsquo; to automate the development or deployment of a proven pattern, best practice, or solution for reuse across projects. VSPAT was contributed by Microsoft, Outercurve&rsquo;s founding sponsor.<br />
<br />
VSPAT meets the needs of organizations that develop custom solutions and seek greater return on investment by capturing and re-using the patterns of such solutions. VSPAT offers tools to ensure solution scalability for IT professionals building and deploying custom solutions, improving quality, consistency and time to market. VSPAT also provides a new way to capture, communicate, and deploy best practices, code and script samples, as well as architectural or technology patterns in instructional, configurable and customizable pattern toolkits.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;VSPAT is about arming communities, customers and partners with the ability to economically create custom development and deployment tools. It was created to make building custom tooling easier, cheaper and within the reach of any IT professional,&rdquo; said project creator Jezz Santos. &ldquo;We are very pleased to contribute the project to Outercurve and to join this growing community.&rdquo; VSPAT is distributed under the Apache 2.0 license. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;The VSPAT project has demonstrated enormous potential for revolutionizing the custom solution development industry,&rdquo; said Paula Hunter, Executive Director, Outercurve Foundation. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re pleased to accept VSPAT into the DLSI gallery, where support from the larger FOSS community will help it flourish and evolve.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
VSPAT is available for download at http://vspat.codeplex.com/. For more information on the DLSI Gallery or the Outercurve Foundation please visit . <br />
