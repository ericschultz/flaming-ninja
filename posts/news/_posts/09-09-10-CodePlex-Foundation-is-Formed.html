<p>The CodePlex Foundation, a non-profit foundation formed with the  mission of enabling the exchange of code and understanding among  software companies and open source communities, launched today,  September 10, 2009.</p>
<p>Incorporated as a 501.c6 non-profit, the CodePlex Foundation was  created as a forum in which open source communities and the software  development community can come together with the shared goal of  increasing participation in open source community projects. The CodePlex  Foundation will complement existing open source foundations and  organizations, providing a forum in which best practices and shared  understanding can be established by a broad group of participants, both  software companies and open source communities. Initial funding for the  Foundation comes from Microsoft Corporation.</p>
<p>Sam Ramji will serve as interim President of the Foundation. He will  be supported by an interim Board of Directors, whose other members are  Bill Staples, Stephanie Boesch, Miguel de Icaza, Britt Johnston, and  Shaun Walker. Mr. Ramji and the interim Board will immediately begin a  search for a permanent Executive Director, who will manage the day-today  operations of the Foundation, as well as a permanent Board of Directors  and a Board of Advisors.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways for individuals and companies to  participate in the Foundation - via sponsorship, or by becoming a member  of the Board of Directors or Board of Advisors. To explore  participation or propose a candidate for the Board of Directors or Board  of Advisors, visit the <a href="/participate.aspx">Participate</a> section of the  Foundation website. Over the coming months, the Board will determine how  projects are accepted as it defines project governance, which will  provide clarity on how individuals or companies can contribute projects.</p>
