<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Seattle, WA. March 17 2010</b> - The CodePlex Foundation today announced the creation of its second project gallery, the Systems Infrastructure and Integration Gallery, and the acceptance of the first project into that gallery, the Network Monitor Parsers Project. The gallery and project, contributed by Microsoft, the Foundation’s founding sponsor, were evaluated for acceptance using the Foundation’s </font><a target="_blank" href="http://www.codeplex.org/docs/CPF_Project_Acceptance_and_Operation-DRAFT.pdf"><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#0000ff"><u>Project Acceptance and Operation Guidelines</u></font></a><font size="3" face="Arial">.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Interoperability is a key need for IT customers who increasingly rely on heterogeneous computing environments. While open APIs and documented technical bridges from technology providers help assure interoperability, CodePlex.org believes that the collaborative open source development process benefits everyone. The Systems Infrastructure and Integration Gallery serves the Foundation’s mission of enabling the exchange of code and information by helping corporations harness open source to meet the interoperability challenge.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The Network Monitor Parsers project, the gallery’s anchor project, is an important first step in the overall Network Monitor&#160;project, which will open up specifications for substantial APIs where Windows platform technology interfaces with network protocols. The Foundation’s stewardship of this project assures developers working on interoperability in this area access to the code and information they need.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">“In contributing the Systems Infrastructure and Integration Gallery and Network Monitor Parsers project, Microsoft is renewing the commitment it made to interoperability in the </font><a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/Interop/osp/default.mspx"><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#0000ff"><u>Open Specification Promise</u></font></a><font size="3" face="Arial">,” said Paula Hunter, Executive Director, CodePlex Foundation. “We welcome Microsoft’s sponsorship of the Systems Infrastructure &amp; Integration Gallery and encourage corporations and open source developers to contribute additional projects to enable interoperability among a wide range of technologies.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">“This new gallery will open up new opportunities for us to contribute to open source projects that improve interoperability between our platforms and open source technologies,” said Fred Wurden, Partner Product Unit Manager, Microsoft Protocol Team. “The NetMon Parsers project is the first step of many towards building a robust Systems Infrastructure and Interoperability Gallery that will significantly improve interoperability and development/testing fundamentals across a wide variety of systems.”</font></p>
