<p><a href="http://www.chronozoomproject.org/"><span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif;">ChronoZoom</span></a><span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif; color: windowtext;">, an open source project supported by the Outercurve Foundation, today announced that it has received the South by Southwest (SXSW) Interactive Award for Educational Resource. The SXSW Interactive Awards recognize the years&rsquo; best new digital work and celebrates technologists who are building tomorrow's interactive trends. The award has been granted for the past 16 years, and is among the technology industry&rsquo;s most prestigious honors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif; color: windowtext;">Microsoft Research (MSR), the University of California Berkeley, and Moscow University created ChronoZoom to help uncover the crosscurrents of history that exist among disparate data sets &ndash; a capability that makes it easier to study &ldquo;</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_History"><span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif;">Big History</span></a><span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif;">.</span>&rdquo;<span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif; color: windowtext;"> ChronoZoom displays these insights on a timeline that reveals interrelations throughout geography, culture and history, as well as across multiple disciplines of academic research.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0in; border: medium none;"><span style="font-family: calibri,sans-serif; color: windowtext;">&ldquo;The ChronoZoom team exemplifies the best of collaborative research and open source software development,&rdquo; said Outercurve Foundation president Paula Hunter. &ldquo;This award is just the beginning of exciting growth for the ChronoZoom team, and we look forward to their continued success as they attract new contributors around the world, and allow us to explore new content and history.&rdquo;</span></p>
