<p>Companies have been concerned about software license compliance with respect to free and open source software for some time.  Part of this is due to simple competitive FUD designed to frighten people away from using FOSS or to sell services and tools around it, and part of this was due to genuine concern with license compliance when lawsuits appear because of violations.  The Linux Foundation announced the <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/programs/legal/compliance">Open Compliance Program</a> at LinuxCon in Boston today to help companies understand and manage such compliance needs.  </p>
<p>The issue isn't really one of FOSS usage.  The Internet made collaborative software development and  software publication easy.  Software from proprietary sources with ambiguous licenses (e.g. MSDN, the Oracle developer network) can enter the software development chain as easily as FOSS.  As Jim Zemlin pointed out in <a href="http://www.linux-foundation.org/weblogs/jzemlin/2010/08/10/introducing-the-open-compliance-program/">his blog announcing the program</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<em>I also want to be very clear: complying with open source licenses is actually easier than complying with proprietary ones. (One reason: there is no money involved.) There are countless software audits of users every year, and settlements often range in the tens of millions for large companies. You may not have heard about those cases since they do not get the attention the very few open source cases do, but make no mistake, complying with proprietary licenses is not easy or cheap.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>This new program provides tools, guidance, and training to allow commercial organizations to better track and comply with the software licenses that govern the use of the external software they use in their products.  The six components announced today:
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Training and Education</strong>: <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/programs/legal/compliance/training-and-education">Training modules</a> cover the fundamentals of open source licensing and compliance activities. There are also free white papers, articles, and webinars available from noted compliance experts.</li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong>: The LF has developed tools to help companies improve their open source compliance due diligence. Initial versions of two of these tools are released as open source projects.  The tools include (from the press release):
<ul>
<em><li>Dependency Checker: capable of identifying code combinations at the dynamic and static link level. In addition, the tool offers a license policy framework that enables FOSS Compliance Officers to define combinations of licenses and linkage methods that are to be flagged if found as a result of running the tool.</li>
<li>Bill of Material (BoM) Difference Checker: capable of reporting differences between BoMs and therefore enabling companies to identify changed source code components and to better report included open source components in updated product releases. Development on the BOM Difference Checker will begin in late 2010.</li>
<li>The Code Janitor: This tool provides linguistic review capabilities to make sure developers did not leave comments in the source code about future products, product code names, mention of competitors, etc. The tool maintains a database of keywords that are scanned for in the source code files to ensure code released is safe and ready for public consumption.</li></em>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Self-Assessment Checklist</strong>: The LF has developed an extensive checklist of compliance best practices and tasks to support an open source compliance program.  Companies can use this checklist as an internal self-administered program.  [The checklist will be formally launched in late 2010.]</li>
<li><strong>The SPDX Standard Workgroup</strong>: The LF now manages <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/workgroups/spdx">the workgroup</a> for the Software Package Data eXchange specification.  When completed, the specification will allow companies to report a standardized bill of materials for their software if it's required by their downstream users.
[This is especially important for consumer electronics manufacturers who assemble parts from a variety of suppliers into their shipping products.]</li>
<li><strong>A Compliance Directory and Rapid Alert System</strong>: The LF has <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/programs/legal/compliance/directory/">created a directory</a> of compliance officers at companies using FOSS in their commercial products so communication about licenses and compliance can flow more easily. Itâ€™s often difficult for open source projects to identify the correct people at companies using their software to address issues of concern.</li>
<li><strong>Community</strong>: The above collection of resources will be driven through the existing <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/workgroups/fossbazaar">FOSSBazaar</a> workgroup as a co-ordination point.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is an important program and it has <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/node/6536">broad industry support</a> as of today in the announcement, including support from the CodePlex Foundation.  By providing these tools and educational services, the Open Compliance Program complements the CodePlex Foundation mission to increase corporate contribution and participation in the open source world, and we heartily endorse and support it. </p>
