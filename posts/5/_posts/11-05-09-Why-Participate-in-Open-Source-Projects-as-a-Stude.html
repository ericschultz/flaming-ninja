<p>FOSS serves as a fundamental training ground for new developers. Good developers know that the way to become a better programmer is to read well-written programs. Good FOSS projects in dynamic communities provide a wealth of examples for computing students to read, understand, and work on to improve their understanding. Even if a student never makes a contribution back to the community, reading and understanding projects that interest them or relate to their courses improve their skills. </p> <p>Participating and contributing in a FOSS project community brings new benefits. <ul> <li>One gets the real world experience of participating in a distributed team. The communications and social skills learned by participating in a FOSS project’s distributed community will be essential. </li> <li>Development skills get honed. Contributing code and having it critically reviewed improves programming skills. </li> <li>Seeing and participating in the software engineering development process of a mature well-run FOSS project gives a student experience in version control and configuration management tools, regular automated builds, and testing and packaging issues. </li> <li>Job and career success often comes through the connections one has in one’s networks. FOSS projects can provide literally a global network of connections.</li> <li>Having publicly participated in FOSS projects, a candidate has a very public demonstration of what they have done, and not what they say they have done. This is much better for an employer than simply a resume. </li> </ul> </p> <p>While all of these benefits accrue to any participant in the FOSS project community, they are especially useful to students graduating into a highly competitive job market with little prior experience on a resume.
