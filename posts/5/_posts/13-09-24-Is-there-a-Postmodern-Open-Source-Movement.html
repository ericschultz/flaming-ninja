James Governor started a meme off with a tweet almost a year ago. <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p>"younger devs are about POSS - Post open source software. f*** the license and governance, just commit to github." <a href="http://t.co/t29L8FHi">http://t.co/t29L8FHi</a></p>

<p> It called into question a general lack of licensing on Github and whether or not licensing was still relevant. It provoked a lot of discussion from folks (including me) on why licenses were necessary. The laisser-faire attitude towards licensing seemed to continue through the Spring. When I saw a professional developer from a large commercial software company post code on Github without a license I was horrified. The Apocalypse was definitely Now and I <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/Blogs/EntryId/100/Everything-You-NEED-to-Know-About-Software-Copyright-and-Licensing-to-Share-in-2-Minutes">responded bluntly.</a> </p>
<p>Henrik Ingo (<a href="https://twitter.com/h_ingo">@h_ingo</a>) evolved the discussion and anchored a couple of sessions at the <a href="http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/">Community Leadership Summit</a> in July that extended the idea a bit and asked the question whether or not we were living in a postmodern open source world. One participant with a role spanning the boundary between arts culture and technology boundary made a brilliant observation that I hopefully captured in the tweet: </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p>Post-modern FOSS will deconstruct the defining concepts making the movement "founders" very uncomfortable e.g. Licensing. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CLS13&amp;src=hash">#CLS13</a></p>

<p> I had one of those A-ha moments that maybe I was indeed part of the problem instead of being part of the solution! While I certainly didn&rsquo;t contribute to the open source definition, I have built a business on open source, survived the due diligence when we sold it to Microsoft, and worked to evolve the discussion of open source in business as best I can for some time. Here I was clinging to pesky old copyright laws! Laws that I strongly suspect were wrenched into position around software at a time between Watson&rsquo;s misquote about there not being a market for more than five computers and Gate&rsquo;s misquote on 640K being sufficient memory for some time. Licensing around copyright was the problem not the solution! </p>
<p>Software is now enormously more complex than when we were printing out paper source listings and literally filing them with the U.S. Copyright Office. Writing good software is hard work. Developing good software for broad use is harder still. So software re-use practices have driven the creation of software for decades and the result of all this work has been to drive the creation of more and better software while coding less. &ldquo;Copying&rdquo; in our corner of the technical world is a Good Thing&trade; by all the rules of engineering economics. This is not about plagiarism and claiming other&rsquo;s work as your own, it&rsquo;s about copying. </p>
<p>So what is Post Open Source Software? Is it like Postmodernism? If the Open Source Definition is all about the attributes a license must support, then Postmodern discussions must attack the license? When we look at a definition of postmodernism we see elements of it. </p>
<p> postmodernism |pōstˈm&auml;dərˌnizəm|<br />
noun <br />
a late-20th-century style and concept in the arts, architecture, and criticism that represents a departure from modernism and has at its heart a general distrust of grand theories and ideologies as well as a problematical relationship with any notion of &ldquo;art.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Typical features include a deliberate mixing of different artistic styles and media, the self-conscious use of earlier styles and conventions, and often the incorporation of images relating to the consumerism and mass communication of late-20th-century postindustrial society. Postmodernist architecture was pioneered by Robert Venturi; the AT&amp;T skyscraper in New York (completed in 1984) is a prime example of the style. Influential literary critics include Jean Baudrillard and Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Lyotard. <br />
DERIVATIVES postmodernist noun&amp; adjective, <br />
postmodernity |ˌpōstməˈdərnətē|noun </p>
<p> The definition captures a general &ldquo;who cares what the old school thinks&rdquo; attitude, a certain &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t need a license to share&rdquo; ethic, and a sense that &ldquo;the old way&rdquo; is stifling and restrictive born of a different time so no longer relevant. Those of us with grey hair even responded appropriately with sufficient St&uuml;rm und Drang to demonstrate exactly how inflexibly we see things. </p>
<p> It is well worth taking the time to read (or re-read) Karl Fogel&rsquo;s excellent essay &ldquo;<a href="http://questioncopyright.org/promise">The Surprising History of Copyright and The Promise of a Post-Copyright World</a>&rdquo;. Copyright was indeed a statute that began (and continues) as a legal mechanism to protect the distribution channel, not the asset creator. When the cost of delivering a copy to an audience is high, it&rsquo;s not an unreasonable system, but when the cost drops to zero for delivery of an electronic copy then other business models can assert themselves. So to with software development. </p>
<p>Indeed r0ml walked us perfectly through the brokenness of software copying, copyright infringement silliness in headers, and licensing in <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/13395">an OSCON talk </a>demonstrating that it is so fraught at this point that the only logical conclusion left to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; the intellectual asset as intellectual property may be to patent it. </p>
<p>Over the past couple of years we&rsquo;ve also seen people begin to question the value of open source foundations, <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/open-source-software/has-apache-lost-its-way-225267">most recently</a> the Apache Software Foundation. As free and open source software foundations are ultimately all about intellectual asset management, this can be seen through one lens as an extension of the debate about the value of copyrights and licenses again. </p>
<p>Ultimately, I drift back to Karl&rsquo;s essay. Free and open source software used copyright as the very tool to overturn a relatively short-lived proprietary software world, which started when marketing and distribution was as great a cost as the development of the software. It&rsquo;s not that one can&rsquo;t charge or shouldn&rsquo;t charge for software, but liberal FOSS licensing has certainly rationalized the cost structures. </p>
<p>Artists and authors still use copyright to claim their works, then build and distribute their work with creative licenses, channels, and campaigns as we&rsquo;ve seen with the Creative Commons, Internet distribution of free music, and various KickStarter and Indiegogo projects. Software isn&rsquo;t different in this regard. Ignoring copyrights and eschewing licenses will only see one&rsquo;s work ultimately capped within projects that have no commercial interest. If a musician wishes to only enjoy their creations in jam sessions with other musicians in coffee houses, and such musicians exist, then they don&rsquo;t need the commercial channel. If the musician wants to enjoy wider play and remix then they need to step into the world of licensing and copyright. So too with software creations. </p>
<p>By all means create. Write and build great software. Publish and share it. At the very least others may gain insights into interesting algorithm implementations. But if you care about reaching a wider audience, and enjoying a wider collaboration from which you may learn things yourself, you should claim your copyright and license your software. It&rsquo;s not about living in a post open source world. Free and open source licensing IS the hack on copyright that turned the distribution channel on its head. </p>
