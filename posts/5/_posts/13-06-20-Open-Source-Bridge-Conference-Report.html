<p>I have a new favourite conference.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve spent the past two days at <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/">Open Source Bridge</a> in Portland OR.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a fascinating event.&nbsp; I joked at first that it was &ldquo;very Portland&rdquo;, but what does that really mean. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Like the city itself, it&rsquo;s just the right size.&nbsp; There are about 300 attendees, and another 100 speakers and volunteers.&nbsp; So one isn&rsquo;t overwhelmed with calendar conflicts and too much choice, and one can actually enjoy the conference.&nbsp; The conference is volunteer run.&nbsp; Yes, this keeps costs down, but more importantly there&rsquo;s a strong sense of community and community building that permeates the conference.&nbsp; That sense of community is also interesting because there&rsquo;s definitely a strong local contingent of Portland natives, a reasonable number of West Coast open source folks that come up from the Bay Area, but also just enough people flying in from further afield to keep a good mix.&nbsp; The venue is equally interesting and &ldquo;just the right size&rdquo; and the main <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/blog/2011/03/hacker-lounge-returns-to-open-source-bridge/">hacker lounge </a>is full of comfortable chairs and tables and people gathering meeting and hacking. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a number of the presenters before at other conferences, and the Open Source Bridge organizers are a strong enough group to pull in excellent speakers.&nbsp; The schedule is broken out into <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/events/2013/tracks">five streams</a>: Business, Chemistry, Cooking, Culture, and Hacks.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an excellent mix that ranges from the nuts-and-bolts of a great &ldquo;A-ha&rdquo; hack to why and how we hack as people, because ultimately software is a human endeavour.&nbsp;&nbsp; And maybe again this is a reflection on the pervading sense of community at the conference. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Three noteworthy talks for me were:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ward Cunningham talked about <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1080">the work he&rsquo;s been doing inverting the sense of wikis</a> (central server) with federated content management &mdash; the best way I can describe it is finding a managed middle ground between historical wikis and pure websites referencing other websites via URLs. </li>
    <li>Duke Leto talked about <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1131">how he organized PDXGit</a>, the Portland Git User Group, and how you can clone his structure (of course).&nbsp; Best funny moment of the conference for me was discovering Duke&rsquo;s tagline of &ldquo;Put a bird on your DAG.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>Vicky Brasseur talked about the results of a survey of open source project participants she did in a talk perfectly named: &ldquo;<a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/957">No, I Won't Contribute to Your Open Source Project</a>&rdquo;</li>
    <p>I cannot finish this discussion without <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/wiki/2013/Catering">raving about the food</a>.&nbsp; The food is the best food I have ever seen at a conference.&nbsp; It may be vegetarian but it is awesome, and reflects the fantastic Portland food experience.&nbsp; One is not being jammed full of hotel or conference centre food normally associated with events.&nbsp; It was all fantastic, including the healthy snacks at coffee breaks. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>The <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/">conference website</a> is well organized and captures the talks (including past years).&nbsp; I would encourage you take a wander through the site, and mark your calendars for next year in June.&nbsp;</p>
</ul>
