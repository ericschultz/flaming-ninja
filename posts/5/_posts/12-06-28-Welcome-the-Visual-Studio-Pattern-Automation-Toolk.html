I'm glad to welcome the Visual Studio Pattern Automation Toolkit (VSPAT project) to the Data, Language and Systems Interoperability Gallery. VSPAT is an evolution of popular Microsoft automation technologies that presents a new and vital approach for capturing and templatizing reusable custom IT solutions. The approach has proved to re-deliver solutions reliably and in a fraction of the time across multiple projects with differing requirements. VSPAT is a systematic way for IT experts and solution delivery organizations/communities/individuals to scale their expertise economically, reliably and predictably.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This project was developed by members of the Microsoft field organization and their partners who specialize in re-delivering high-quality custom IT solutions across industries. The new model-driven tool set and approach changes the way individuals and organizations design, build and deploy their repeatable solutions by capturing, incorporating and scaling-out their best practices, domain knowledge and expertise.&nbsp; It helps ensure the consistency, predictability, supportability and maintenance of solutions through pattern re-use.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Be part of the community that shapes how this tool set should evolve to meet the needs of all organizations wishing to optimize the re-delivery of their expertise and automate their custom solutions.<br />
