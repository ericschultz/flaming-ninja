<p><em>This post is the fourth in a series that will explore why businesses should become active participants in open source communities. We&rsquo;ll explore what open source is, the economics of OSS (open source software), who uses it, how to make projects successful, and how to participate in external projects. It will also taken a deep dive into more complex topics such as the commercialization of FOSS, community vs customers, managing inbound IP, licenses, software hygiene, and when NOT to publish a project.<br />

Start from the beginning: </em><a href="http://www.outercurve.org/Blogs/EntryId/112/0-Intro-What-is-OSS">Intro.&nbsp; What is it?</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Producing OSS (Part 2 - Making)</strong></p>
<p> Creating an open source software project requires some thought and planning.&nbsp; First, it all starts with software.&nbsp; The program must do something useful from the beginning.&nbsp;Open source software developer communities are predominantly a discussion that starts with code, and without the code there is no discussion.&nbsp;A fledgling community can come together to discuss a problem or even propose solutions, but sooner or later someone needs to commit to writing the first workable software that will be the center of gravity for all other conversations. </p>
<p>But not all projects are built from scratch. There needs to be certain considerations with respect to the ownership and licensing when an existing body of software is to be published into an open source community.&nbsp;Software is covered by digital copyright and someone owns that copyright.&nbsp;Publishing existing software requires the owners to agree to the publication and licensing as OSS. The weight of existing code and its cultural history need to be considered, and may affect the early project community.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The crucial question is, however: Why open source? What motivates the publication of software under an open source license?&nbsp;Why share the software?&nbsp;Why not commercialize it?</p>
<p>As we have seen, the economics of collaboratively developing software are compelling.&nbsp;Writing good software is hard work, and managing its evolution is equally challenging and can be both costly and time consuming. Sharing good software and collaboratively developing and maintaining it will distribute those costs across a group.&nbsp;Publishing the software as open source, and building a development community (however small) is motivated by a desire to evolve the software, &nbsp;share its value and be open to the idea that others in the community will share their domain expertise, learn the software&rsquo;s structure, and share the costs of evolution.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The economics of open source development are also asymmetrical.&nbsp;For a contributor, the effort may represent a small bit of expertise (e.g. a single bug fix or particular application of an algorithm), but they are rewarded with the community investment of the entire package of software at relatively small personal cost.&nbsp;Likewise, the contribution is valuable to the software&rsquo;s developer and user community at large without necessarily carrying the costs of the contributor as a full time member in the developer community.&nbsp; (Indeed a single contribution may have been the only value the contributor had to give in a particular instance.)&nbsp; </p>
<p>Having the motivation to build an open source community is essential, as are knowledge of the problem domain and the understanding of the software needed to anchor the community.&nbsp;The essential motivation to share the software liberally under an open source license will support the commitment and investment it will take to maintain enough domain expertise and software knowledge to keep the community going and growing.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s difficult for the community to evolve the software and thrive without providing these three key elements.</p>
<p>One of the first structural considerations needs to be which open source software license to use for the project.&nbsp;There are an array of licenses that have been approved by the Open Source Initiative as supporting the <a href="http://opensource.org/osd-annotated">Open Source Definition</a>, a set of principles for freedom and sharing, but there are really just a few that typically need consideration (there&rsquo;s a more in-depth discussion on licenses later in this guide). The most important thing to realize when choosing a license is that it doesn&rsquo;t just outline the legal responsibilities for how the software is shared, but it also outlines the social contract for how the community will share.</p>
<p>The next structural consideration for a community is to choose a tool platform to support collaborative development.&nbsp;This is the hub for activity for managing source code versions, distributing software, handling the lines of communications, and logging issues and bugs.&nbsp;There are a number of free forge sites (e.g. Codeplex, Google Code, GitHub, and SourceForge), which serve as source code repositories and collaboration platforms.&nbsp; Likewise the tools themselves all exist as open source software for a project to develop and manage its own site.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The last structural consideration involves deciding what sort of community is most desirable to develop.&nbsp;This all comes under the idea of governance and involves considerations for how decisions are made about what and by who.&nbsp; People often discuss projects as meritocracies similar to the Eclipse and Apache projects, or a benevolent dictatorship similar to the Linux kernel project.</p>
<p>There are two very good books available that discuss community development practices:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in; list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><a href="http://www.artofcommunityonline.org/about/">The Art of Community</a> by Jono Bacon</li>
    <li><a href="http://producingoss.com/">Producing Open Source Software</a> by Karl Fogel</li>
</ul>
<p> Contribution is the life-blood of an open source software community.&nbsp;It leads to new developers joining the project and learning enough to becoming committers with the responsibility for the code base and its builds, and it&rsquo;s what makes the shared economic cost work for the project.&nbsp;Contributors generally start as users of the software.&nbsp;This means that a project community that&rsquo;s hoping to attract contributors first needs to attract users.&nbsp;The project&rsquo;s initial participants must build a solid on-ramp to convert users into contributors by making the software easy-to-use, ensuring that it&rsquo;s discoverable, downloadable, and has a quick and easy installation and configuration.</p>
<p>Not all users will contribute.&nbsp;Some may never push the software enough to need to make a change, or it may already solve their problems.&nbsp;Some contributors will contribute in very simple ways, reporting bugs for particular use cases; others may contribute more, and this is where the second on-ramp needs to be developed by the community.&nbsp;Contributors need to know what sorts of contributions are encouraged, how to contribute, and where.&nbsp;Having scripts and notes on building the software and testing the baseline build encourage potential contributing developers to get involved.&nbsp; Building an open source software project follows this pattern: </p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in; list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There needs to be useful software to seed a community&rsquo;s growth.</li>
    <li>Motivation to share, expertise in the problem to be solved, and an understanding of the software structure will anchor an open source community. The project founder is the starting point for what will hopefully become a community.</li>
    <li>The project needs to have the structural issues of license, forge, and governance spelled out, even if governance becomes an evolving discussion in a growing community.</li>
    <li>The community needs to build helpful on-ramps for users and contributors.&nbsp;The sooner this happens in a project&rsquo;s life, the faster it can build a community. </li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s entirely possible to publish software under an open source license and never build a community.&nbsp;In that case, the software isn&rsquo;t necessarily lost, but neither is it hardened or evolved. It may be useful to someone that discovers it, but the dynamic aspects of software development are lost to it.&nbsp;Taking the steps to encourage and build a community around the open source project sets the dynamic software engine in motion and allows the economics of collaborative development and sharing to work at its best. Don&rsquo;t just give your software a license and hope for the best.</p>
