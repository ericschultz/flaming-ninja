<p><em>This post is the sixth in a series that will explore why businesses should become active participants in open source communities. We&rsquo;ll explore what open source is, the economics of OSS (open source software), who uses it, how to make projects successful, and how to participate in external projects. It will also taken a deep dive into more complex topics such as the commercialization of FOSS, community vs customers, managing inbound IP, licenses, software hygiene, and when NOT to publish a project.</em><em><br />

<h2>Producing Commercial OSS (Part 2 - Creating a Project)</h2>
<br />
A company considering creating its own open source licensed projects is a much more interesting conversation.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s start with the motivation again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Individuals are often very good at understanding their &ldquo;gut&rdquo; motivation for doing something.&nbsp; The larger a company becomes the more thought and documentation needs to go into such decisions, especially once a company goes public.&nbsp;
<p>If the project to be published under an open source license is &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; for the company, then the motivations are all based on shared innovation and distributed engineering economics.&nbsp; This is what we see with data center-centric projects created by the likes of Amazon, Yahoo, Google, Twitter, Netflix, or the Facebook Open Hardware Initiative.&nbsp; The company starting the project is sharing work in which they have invested time and energy in the hopes that others will join the project, use it in new ways thereby hardening the software and contributing at the very least bug reports, but also hopefully extending and evolving it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When this is the motivation, all the discussion in the previous chapters comes into play around making open source.&nbsp; Essentially, one needs: </p>
<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;Useful software as a base around which to build a community.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in; list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Motivation to share, credible expertise in the problem to be solved, and an understanding of the software structure to anchor the open source community.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>The project needs to have the structural issues of license, forge, and governance decided, even if governance becomes an evolving discussion in a growing community.</li>
    <li>The community needs to build a solid onramp to encourage use, and a second onramp for users to become contributors.&nbsp; The sooner this happens in a project&rsquo;s life, the faster it can build a community.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;The additional consideration to encourage corporate participation and contribution needs to be software ownership, legal risk, and IP management around the contributions.&nbsp; This is where considering using existing open source software foundations comes into play.&nbsp; Corporations are far more likely to contribute their software to a neutral non-profit for mutual benefit than a competitor or partner. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Using free and open source software in a commercial setting doesn&rsquo;t change the nature of running a business.&nbsp;&nbsp; One needs to clearly understand that customers buy solutions to problems and what problem the company is solving.&nbsp; Taking a portfolio approach of products, components, services, and open source projects allows a company to play with their pricing models and differentiate themselves for customers against similar competitors. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Open source software can play a number of roles in such a portfolio approach.&nbsp; A company can: </p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in; list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Sell support, upgrades, customization, training and &ldquo;stability&rdquo; to a product that is otherwise provided as an open source project.&nbsp; The best example is probably Red Hat &ldquo;selling Linux&rdquo; when it doesn&rsquo;t own the core IP.&nbsp; The &ldquo;product&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t the software. </li>
    <li>Sell a core product (licensed as proprietary or open source) while encouraging an ecosystem of complements from partners around open source licensed projects.</li>
    <li>Allow customers to try the &ldquo;product&rdquo; as a set of unsupported unwarranted binaries for &ldquo;free&rdquo;, i.e. downloading the community/developer editions, to self-qualify themselves in the sales pipeline.&nbsp; (This was very much how MySQL built both its businesses.) </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;These items all speak to the delivery of the product and the pipeline.&nbsp; A company can also develop a community of users of the open source project that act as a source of expertise and experience for potential customers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;A community of developers and users is an essential piece of the whole solution a company delivers to customer.&nbsp; Some companies develop large successful communities without ever publishing their product software.&nbsp; IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP have all done this to great success.&nbsp; This is why community building is so important for your company and why community development is an essential ingredient in your solution pitch to customers.&nbsp; User and developer communities:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Anchor customers both in a relationship with the company and with the technology. </p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in; list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Create knowledge, expertise and experience necessary to provide a complete solution for the technology pitch to the customer.&nbsp; These proof points are invaluable when potential customers are self-qualifying themselves and testing the strength of a solution&rsquo;s community. </li>
    <li>Create advocates and evangelists to spread awareness about a solution. </li>
    <li>Create enormous inertia in the status quo around a technology. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;These variations all rely on remembering a couple of related &ldquo;rules&rdquo;: </p>
<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;An open source licensed project is not a complete product solution for most people.&nbsp; Even if it installs cleanly, there are still support, warrantees, and risk mitigation that all come into play for a paying customer&rsquo;s peace of mind.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in; list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Project community users and developers are not solution customers.&nbsp; (Community members tend to have time to spend on a solution but no money, while customers have money and are looking for fast time-to-solution and certain guarantees.) </li>
</ul>
<p>Creating an open source project can be as simple as publishing software using an open source license, and this gives customers insight into the workings of a solution.&nbsp; But if you ignore community-building activities, you&rsquo;re losing all the benefits that come from an engaged base of customers and users of your technology.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Clearly understanding the benefits of using open source licensed software for delivering time-to-market, providing a rich complement ecosystem, and enabling communities to anchor the ecosystem in place allows a company to set its motivations correctly.&nbsp; One can discuss the investment in effort as a way to understand the motivation.&nbsp; We can contrast the publication of the software as open source and the effort required to develop the community against the evolution of the commercial product in terms of investment and value returned. </p>
<p>This also allows a company to understand the problems with half measures.&nbsp; Companies sometimes treat open source licensing as marketing pixie dust, instead of rightly understanding its place in the solution portfolio or the need to build genuine community that will lead to solving customer problems, and ultimately delighting said customers which can be measured in profitability.&nbsp; They try to limit access and only approach community half-heartedly because ultimately they&rsquo;re unsure of the benefits.&nbsp; Fully appreciating the benefits allows a company to fully engage with both community and customers to solve problems.</p>
