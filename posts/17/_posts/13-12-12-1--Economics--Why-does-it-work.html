<p><em><em>This post is the second in a series that will explore why businesses should become active participants in open source communities. We&rsquo;ll explore what open source is, the economics of OSS (open source software), who uses it, how to make projects successful, and how to participate in external projects. It will also taken a deep dive into more complex topics such as the commercialization of FOSS, community vs customers, managing inbound IP, licenses, software hygiene, and when NOT to publish a project.</em></em></p>

<p>Liberally licensed collaborative software works because the underlying fundamental economics do. Everyone is familiar with the idea of a normal "bell curve&rdquo; distribution representing R&amp;D investment over time. As a technology is better understood, a product succeeds in the marketplace and even newer technologies advance, R&amp;D for the original technology and product wanes. The integral of the bell curve represents the total R&amp;D investment over time. The function can also represent the "knowledge" gained or the increase in the intellectual asset base.</p>

<p>Good companies develop and invest in successive waves of sustaining technologies. For example, take Microsoft's success with PC operating systems; DOS was replaced by a greater investment in a more innovative Windows, which was later replaced by a larger investment in a more innovative NT. </p>

<p>This also fits nicely with Christensen's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Business-Essentials/dp/0060521996/oncemoreuntot-20">original observations</a> about incumbent companies being good at sustained innovations and well-run companies knowing how to jump from technology to technology along a sustaining innovation path. This all makes sense when considering a single company's R&amp;D investment. It applied equally well to Sun Microsystems when considering that the steeper slope of successive sustaining innovations was on the hardware side versus the slower (but not inconsiderable) investment from SunOS (a BSD variation of the UNIX system) to Solaris (a System V variation). </p>

<p>The investment curve for projects like Linux and Apache, with many individual and corporate contributors, still looks like a bell curve, but the contributions might better be viewed as a stacked bar chart. Individual contributors invest to meet their specific needs. Because there is enormous overlap in their common needs, the companies all share the overall investment. </p>
<p><img alt="" width="565" height="336" src="/Portals/0/images/blog/ch.1img5.gif" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individual contributors get enormous return on their investment: one gives a few bug fixes to the Apache httpd team, and in return one gets an entire HTTP daemon. Corporate contributors give for the same ROI. They get enormous return on their investment in technology they use in a product complement space or as a component in their overall solution to the customer. In the example below, Red Hat understood how to brand the "solution" in the customer&rsquo;s mind as "UNIX-like servers on inexpensive 'PC' hardware" &ndash; it was not about delivering yet another Linux distro. </p>

Christensen was careful in subsequent work to point out that the disruption isn&rsquo;t about technology but about business model. The disruption often starts when someone assembles standard, cheaper, lower-performing parts into a solution that solves a completely different need with a very different cost basis The new solution then begins its own sustaining innovation curve until it can compete with the incumbent in terms of &nbsp;criteria that are important to the customer.. This was very visible when companies began embedding Linux in switches, routers, and point-solution servers, helping it to evolve into the operating system it is today, powering everything from mobile phones to server farms for the Internet giants.&nbsp; <em><br />

<p>The disruptive business model isn't about Linux software technology so much as the ability for corporations to do collaborative development at the component/complement level in a "frictionless," well-managed, Internet-enabled community. Linux is a much stronger disruptive business <em>solution</em> as a way to handle a particular operating system kernel-sourcing problem.</p>
<p>One only need read the report from the Linux Foundation <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/publications/whowriteslinux.pdf">charting the growth statistics</a> in the Linux kernel to understand the enormous value generation happening release-on-release, four times a year. Looking at the Ohloh online statistics for the Linux kernel, one can see enormous activity. Using the Ohloh rules-of-thumb (based on the COCOMO model) of US$55,000 per person year, <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/linux">we see US$285M</a> of value creation in the Linux kernel (30-Jul-2013). The fact that some business models have been destroyed (Sun) or threatened (Microsoft) doesn't mean there's not enormous ongoing value creation in the technology.</p>
<p>Some fear that intellectual property is being destroyed through such shared value creation. This isn&rsquo;t true. It is a disruptive business model discussion. Intellectual property is a business choice made about how a company will protect certain intellectual <em>assets</em> as legal <em>property</em>. Which <em>assets</em> to protect, and how, and which <em>property</em> to defend is a business choice based on the cost model a business uses with respect to turning assets into value propositions customers will buy. &nbsp;When a group of companies chooses to collaboratively develop a technology complement/component, they're making a business model choice on how they will share certain intellectual assets to their own selfish needs. No intellectual property is destroyed along the way. </p>
