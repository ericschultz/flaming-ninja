<p>There’s been a lot of discussion in the FOSS community in the last seven days regarding forges and development methodologies. As a founding director and Outercurve board president I thought I’d take a minute and discuss how Outercurve intentionally took a different approach to addressing unmet needs of the open source community.</p> <p>We recognized the primacy of existing foundations for their communities. Complaints of a few developers (<a href="http://www.mikealrogers.com/posts/apache-considered-harmful.html" target="_blank">Mikael Rogers </a>and <a href="http://ceki.blogspot.com/2011/11/confusing-intent-and-outcome.html" target="_blank">Ceki Gulcu</a>) aside, Apache and Eclipse are the perfect solutions for the problems their communities want solved – technical and license alignment around specific ecosystems (web infrastructure and developer tools, respectively). There are foundations for other leading open source projects – <a href="http://openlife.cc/blogs/2010/november/how-grow-your-open-source-project-10x-and-revenues-5x" target="_blank">Henrik Ingo’s research</a> from a year ago still stands, where he demonstrates that Linux, KDE, Apache, Eclipse, Perl+CPAN, Mozilla+Addons, Gnome, Drupal and GNU are an order of magnitude larger than the next major group of open source projects (MySQL, Qt, and others).<br /><br />Arguably a 1% and 99% rule works in the world of open source as well and creates its own critics and protesters. Using this to complain about Apache is, in my opinion, ludicrous. Apache is awesome (see <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/12/02/apache_bureaucracy_wading_into_the_argument/" target="_blank">Matt Asay on the topic</a>). Using this to observe what problems remain unsolved is pragmatic and productive.<br /><br />The key problems that still existed and which we wanted to solve were for smaller projects – those in the 99% - that didn’t fit into an existing foundation’s ecosystem. Those problems were purely legal.<br /><br />Why were the problems purely legal? Because if these projects had fit into an existing ecosystem there would be technical alignment challenges that would have made them want to participate in an existing foundation for the benefits of technical mentoring as well as other foundation features like licensing and copyright management.<br /><br />We wanted to help developers who had a great open source project, didn’t want to be told how or where to develop it, and just wanted help in getting more contributions.<br /><br />Some requirements automatically emerged from this:<br /><br />1) Be excellent at legal process and project governance<br />2) Don’t mandate a specific toolchain<br />3) Don’t mandate a specific forge<br />4) Don’t mandate a specific development methodology<br /><br />The majority of projects that come to us have a project leader with strong professional software development skills who has made his/her forge selection prior to approaching the Foundation. A number of the projects have been public under open source licenses and are looking to take the next step in their growth, so their community is already used to doing work in a particular way and place.<br /><br />This decision is linked to their development methodology, but other factors come into play, namely the robustness of services associated with the forge. Our projects are hosted at Codeplex, Sourceforge, Github, and in a few cases by the organization sponsoring the project.<br /><br />In a couple of cases, we have seen, as a project evolves, the team may choose to shift from one forge to another. I think this flexibility clearly differentiates us from other foundations. Practically speaking, it also means that we are not reinventing the wheel. Managing a forge can be labor and capital intensive, and leveraging the options available in the FOSS arena keeps our costs down while giving the project leaders best in class choices.<br /><br />While some of our project leaders are experienced, many have come to us for guidance on licensing and governance, and we strive to provide support to the project teams to lighten the administrative burdens associated with managing a project and growing a community. We continue to look at the projects throughout their lifecycle to identify those tasks our team can take on to allow our contributors to focus on writing great code.<br /><br />Our flexibility is also applicable to licensing, as we have chosen to accept projects that are licensed under any OSI recognized open source license. While Apache seems to be the leading choice, we have projects licensed under BSD, GPL, MS-PL, and Apache 2.0. Again, I think this flexibility is important, as the projects originate from diverse corporate and academic institutions.<br /><br />Having read through this far, you may still be wondering, “What is the set of legal problems that an open source foundation can or must solve?” Here are the issues that project leaders in the 99% confront repeatedly:</p> <div style="text-indent: -18pt; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span>1)<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"> </span></span>Contribution management</div> <div style="text-indent: -18pt; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 72pt"><span>a.<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"> </span></span>How do we keep the codebase under one legal entity so that it can be relicensed?</div> <div style="text-indent: -18pt; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 72pt"><span>b.<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"> </span></span>How do we keep individuals and corporations on a level playing field?</div> <div style="text-indent: -18pt; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 72pt"><span>c.<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"> </span></span>How do we ensure that a committer who goes to work for a corporation as a full-time employee doesn’t cause the project to be encumbered by their employer?</div> <div style="text-indent: -18pt; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 72pt"><span>d.<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"> </span></span>How can we ensure that committers who make money as individual consultants to corporations can modify the core project in a way that doesn’t cause the project to be encumbered by their employer?</div> <div style="text-indent: -18pt; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span>2)<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"> </span></span>Lawsuit prevention</div> <div style="text-indent: -18pt; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 72pt"><span>a.<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"> </span></span>How do we get legal insurance against predators like NPEs (non-practicing entities – read “patent trolls”) and large software companies?</div> <div style="text-indent: -18pt; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span>3)<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"> </span></span>Donation management</div> <div style="text-indent: -18pt; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 72pt"><span>a.<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"> </span></span>How can we take monetary donation from those who want to support the project but can’t or won’t write a check to an individual developer?</div> <div style="text-indent: -18pt; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span>4)<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"> </span></span>Mentoring and governance</div> <div style="text-indent: -18pt; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 72pt"><span>a.<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"> </span></span>What are the best practices for growing an open source project?</div> <div style="text-indent: -18pt; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 72pt"><span>b.<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"> </span></span>What are the anti-patterns?</div> <div style="text-indent: -18pt; margin: 0pt 0pt 10pt 72pt"><span>c.<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"> </span></span>How does this apply to my specific project and community?</div> <p>This is the problem space that Outercurve is built to solve. After two years’ work, I am happy with the progress we’ve made, both in refining our focus and services, and in partnering with community projects and other community foundations. There is much more to do in the future, but as open source continues to mature, there will be more and more opportunities for the projects in the 99% to develop and be broadly adopted. Our job is to help them all by moving the state of the art of foundations forward.</p>
