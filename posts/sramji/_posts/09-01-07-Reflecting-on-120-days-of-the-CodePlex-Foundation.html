<p><a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20100106113200698">Andy  Updegrove wrote an article</a> this week on the <a href="../../../../../About.aspx">CodePlex Foundation</a>'s progress to  date and where he'd like to see it go.&#160; It put me in a reflective mindset, so I  thought I'd take a minute to publish those thoughts. 120 days, in, what are the  accomplishments of the CodePlex Foundation?<br />
<br />
Back on September 10th, we  set a pretty high bar for what the CodePlex Foundation would accomplish in its  first 100 days of operations.<br />
<br />
I said at the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/CodePlexFoundation/introducing-the-codeplex-foundation-1978061">launch  press conference</a>:</p>
<blockquote>“What are our plans for the first 100 days? We will recruit an  executive director, replace the interim board with a permanent board, establish  a Board of Advisors, and begin to solicit projects.”<br />
</blockquote>
<p>So what did  we actually get done?</p>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Executive Director: "B</strong>
<p>" We have  been working to recruit permanent staff, particularly an Executive Director and  a Technical Director. We announced that search in December but we’ve been  looking at candidates all along. Here I'd give us a B, because we are very close  to making offers to outstanding candidates.&#160; We realized that the technical  leadership and mentoring role would be very important, so we elevated the  priority of hiring a Technical Director.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Permanent Board:</strong> <strong>"C</strong>"&#160; We’re almost at the  point where we can announce a permanent Board of Directors. These will be names  that resonate in open source, academic, and corporate software worlds. Look for  an announcement this month. It was disappointing to miss this goal in the first  100 days, but the interim Board made a decision early to focus on the project  acceptance process, and there we can claim real success. Driven by feedback from  our advisors and directors, two of the current six directors will be returning  to board, with three newcomers.&#160; For the "replacing the Board of Directors"  goal, I give us a C with strong effort.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>Board of Advisors:</strong> <strong>"A"</strong> We were fortunate to  assemble a great Board of Advisors, who we learn from in every Advisors'  meeting.&#160; A very solid core of people has been involved right through and has  been present for every issue.&#160; People like Bob Gobeille, the head of the <a href="http://fossology.org/">FOSSology project</a> and a key contributor to <a href="https://fossbazaar.org/">FOSSbazaar</a>, Aaron Fulkerson of <a href="http://www.mindtouch.com/">Mindtouch</a>, Larry Augustin of <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/">SugarCRM</a>, and <a href="http://stephesblog.blogs.com/">Stephen Walli</a> provided extraordinary  advice very early on. We also had great input from our Microsoft advisors Phil  Haack, Scott Hanselman and Rob Conery, who are deeply invested in the open  source ecosystem for .NET.&#160; Sara Ford, Monty O'Kelley, John Lam, and Monty  Widenius have contributed their expertise at critical points.&#160; Also, we recently  added Advisors <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/ppl/webprofile?vmi=&amp;id=457570&amp;pvs=pp&amp;authToken=JkK_&amp;authType=name&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=ppro_viewmore&amp;lnk=vw_pprofile">Michael  Bechauf</a>, VP of Developer Network and Standards Strategy at SAP as well as  Stuart Cohen, CEO of Collaborative Software Initiative and past Executive  Director of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Development_Labs">OSDL</a> (now  <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a>).&#160; As interim  board members from the Board of Directors transition off as we move to a  permanent board, we hope they will join the Board of Advisors. It’s a  significant time commitment, so I suspect a couple of the current Board of  Advisors will select out and move into a friends-of-the-foundation role.&#160; So for  the Board of Advisors, I'd give the Foundation an A.</p>
<strong>Solicit  Projects: "A-" </strong>
<p>Our biggest stretch accomplishment has been the  acceptance of a technology gallery, the</p>
<a href="../../../../../galleries.aspx">ASP.Net Open Source Gallery</a>
<p>,  and two projects, the</p>
<a href="http://ajax.codeplex.com/">ASP.Net Ajax Library  Project</a>
<p>and the</p>
<a href="http://www.orchardproject.net/">Orchard  Project</a>
<p>. To get that result we first had to develop a project acceptance  process, described in the Project Acceptance and Operations Guidelines document,  which was released in October. With these guidelines in place we were able to  accept a gallery donation and Board members Bill Staples and Shaun Walker drove  that process. The</p>
<a href="../../../../../CPF_Project_Acceptance_and_Operation-DRAFT.pdf">Project  Acceptance and Operations Guidelines</a>
<p>document also described very strong  guiding principles for the Foundation.&#160; We also minted our first Gallery Manager  (Dmitry Robsman).&#160; Ideally I would have liked to have seen us also accept a  community-led project and a non-Microsoft technology stack project.&#160; We're  making progress on both but didn't achieve these in the first 100 days, so I'd  grade our progress at an A-.</p>
<br />
<p><em>Additional achievements:</em></p>
<p><strong>"+</strong>" I think we did well at a technical level in introducing  innovations in contribution agreements, legal structure, licensing agreements  and other functional documents that will make it easier for corporations to  participate in open source, and easier for developers to contribute code and  projects without getting in the weeds with licensing and legal issues. While we  do need to change the <a href="../../../../../Codeplex_Foundation_Contribution_Agreement.pdf">licensing  agreement</a> based on the experience we have had with community contributions,  I think the <a href="../../../../../Codeplex_Foundation_Assignment_Agreement.pdf">assignment  agreement</a> is strong and working as intended.&#160; So far it looks like the  patent aspects of our agreements work as well.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>"<span style="font-size: 11px;">-</span>"</strong> We did not do so  well in broadly communicating the structure and value of these innovations -  people who we explained these to in small group settings or one-on-one  understood pretty quickly, but we didn't figure out how to articulate our work  in a way that it made sense at scale.</p>
<p><strong>"√"</strong> We had another internal stretch goal of signing a second  corporate sponsor in the first 100 days, which we didn't achieve but made good  progress on.</p>
<p><em>Unsung labor:</em></p>
<p>This doesn't include all of the mundane work that the Directors and Advisors,  our Deputy Director Mark Stone, our legal teams at K&amp;L Gates and Greenberg  Traurig, our operations team from Virtual Inc., our site hosting work from  Engage Software, and our marketing team from Topaz Partners have done in raising  a startup off the ground from scratch.&#160; When we launched in September we had no  infrastructure, no management practices, and no permanent staff.&#160; We were a raw  startup in every way.</p>
<p>One thing that many people that I've met don't realize is that the board  members of a non-profit are non-paid volunteers.&#160; Titles like Treasurer and  President just mean that you are doing that much more work for free.&#160; So I  appreciate the support that each of our companies have given us to spend so much  time on this - <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> for Bill, Britt,  and Stephanie, <a href="http://www.dotnetnukecorp.com/">DotNetNuke Corp</a> for  Shaun, <a href="http://novell.com/">Novell</a> for Miguel, and my employer <a href="http://sonoasystems.com/">Sonoa</a> all get our thanks.</p>
<p><em>Closing Thoughts:</em></p>
<p>I think we will continue to learn more as we go along, and our governance and  legal documents may change as we get more advice. What we have to do better is  explain the value of the Foundation. I think we have explained a lot of the  intent and ideals, and we have connected on a detailed level with some community  projects as well as some Microsoft sponsored projects, but we really need to  step up to a new level of effort and be very clear and specific about what our  agreements say, what results they are intended to produce and the process that  wraps them up.</p>
<p>So the next few months will see changes on the Board,  permanent staff, and progress in how we communicate our value propositions.  Making progress there will let us attract new sponsors, especially when people  begin to appreciate the value of the legal innovations we offer to corporate  sponsors.&#160; Longer term I'd like to transition to being a membership-based  organization.</p>
<br />

<p>We have learned a great deal so far; we're grateful to  those who have helped us get this far; and we’re excited about the next period  of growth. Let us know what you think on our</p>
