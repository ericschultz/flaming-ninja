<p>Social media is an integral part of most developers&rsquo; routines and should not be ignored by project leaders. It&rsquo;s where many relevant conversations happen, which create opportunities for FOSS applications to be discovered, discussed and shared by stakeholders. Leaders can gain more reliable insights from more sources than ever via social media. </p>
<p>Open source development is inherently social. IRC chat, e-mail lists, and Web forums made it possible for geographically dispersed developer teams to make software. Every community has its social guidelines, governance, and mission statements, which together provide the <a href="/Blogs/EntryId/73/How-to-Build-a-Better-Developer-Community">social scaffolding</a> for collaboration. Your community will grow, taking on more contributors, all while following a common vision. </p>
<p>E-mail lists and IRC remain valuable tools, but social collaboration has expanded as <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/05/29/social-media-developer-resources/">online communities</a>, including <a href="http://www.dzone.com/">DZone</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit,</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> have become places where enterprise developers can turn to ask questions and locate the information they are looking for. <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> has its own <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2012/07/15/github-is-the-next-big-social-network-powered-by-what-you-do-not-who-you-know/">specialized tools</a>, and is itself a social network. </p>
<p>Overall, social media helps enterprise developers to learn about trends, technologies and solutions that they may not have been familiar with. Black Duck has <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/28/open-source-social/">found</a> that a developer will immediately turn to social media following a failed Google Search. Younger developers have been weaned on social media, and are <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/32-young-people-social-media-bathroom-211016510.html">always connected</a>. </p>
<p>Twitter and Google+ provide for discovery and discussion, and have also created the opportunity for open source thought leaders to gain a social following. Forrester Analyst Tom Grant has <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/TomGrantForr/from-product-management-to-social-product-management">found</a> that Twitter threads heavily influence the justification and requirements phases of an open source &ldquo;purchase&rdquo;. Critics and joiners leave the most feedback, while project leaders often say the least. However, there&rsquo;s even more spectators. </p>
<p>Forrester&rsquo;s Grant has <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/TomGrantForr/from-product-management-to-social-product-management">noted</a> that RSA&rsquo;s <a href="https://community.emc.com/docs/DOC-16360">Archer Community</a> is included in product development in &ldquo;very specific ways at each point in the process.&rdquo; Collabnet, an ALM cloud service providers, examines community behavior to help qualify prospects for lead generation. The same principles apply for open source communities. </p>
<p><strong>Social media recruits developers, ideas</strong> </p>
<p>Why is this effect also true for open source projects? Spectators are would-be participants, and social media helps project leaders to attract new recruits and share information about their projects. Project managers may also be put on the spot to defend critical design decisions, Grant said. </p>
<p>Communication is more bidirectional than ever. It&rsquo;s important to remember that social media is also a listening platform and can assist with project decision-making. That could be simply a community poll or using robust requirements tools, but the influence of social media will invariably change how project managers work. </p>
<p>One consequence may be that requirements will often receive more attention than traditional product management tasks do. Having access to a deeper pool of stakeholders also increases the frequency of user analysis, task analysis, persona development, market analysis, and other related research, Grant <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/TomGrantForr/from-product-management-to-social-product-management">says</a>. </p>
<p>Project leaders will inevitably talk less and listen more because of social media, so being adaptive to a changing communications paradigm is crucial to tapping its benefits. Conversations are happening all over the Web - whether they are planned or not - and can disrupt how project management happens in a very positive way.</p>
