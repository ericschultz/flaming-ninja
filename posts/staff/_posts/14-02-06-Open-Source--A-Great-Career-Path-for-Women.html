---
<p>There are few women developers and even proportionately less working in
open source communities. However, a career in OSS is ideal for women who
are seeking balance in their lives whether the balance is starting a
family or maintaining balance with friends and a strenuous and engaging
hobby. It&rsquo;s well established that there&rsquo;s a shortage of women pursuing
careers in computer science. The Computer Research Association has found that women account for fewer than 13% of undergraduate CS majors, despite computer science skills being in high demand. As few as 1.5% of open source
contributors are women.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s puzzling is that the rate of women leaving profession software
engineering is higher than in law and medical fields. The leave rate of
women from software development can&rsquo;t be adequately explained by it
being a taxing field; it isn&rsquo;t more taxing than law or medicine. There
isn&rsquo;t yet a satisfying explanation for why women leave software
engineering. Open source software (OSS), in spite of the lack of women,
is a good place to hone ones&rsquo; skills and keep skills sharp and relevant
even if one doesn&rsquo;t want to work full time at a software company.</p>
<p>Open source development is social by its nature: a community <a title="Making open source software blog post" href="http://www.outercurve.org/Blogs/EntryId/72/Making-Open-Source-Software" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);">develops the software</span></a>. Well-run projects&nbsp;<a title="webinar" style="letter-spacing: 0px;" href="http://www.outercurve.org/Blogs/EntryId/74/Building-a-Better-Developer-Community-Webinar-Wrap-up" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);">encourage</span></a>&nbsp;strong
communications channels, bring geographically disparate people together
into a unified team working toward a common objective, provide
resources for collaboration, and create a welcoming environment. Those
are all essential community mechanics. Some projects also have
aspirations of social good.&nbsp;<a title="non-profit" style="letter-spacing: 0px;" href="https://www.codemontage.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);">CodeMontage</span></a>&nbsp;is
a non-profit organization that works hard to bring more people into the
open source community and makes contributions to non-profit and
humanitarian causes. It is also excels at applying beginner&rsquo;s talents to
projects. <a title="wesbite" style="letter-spacing: 0px;" href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);">Girl Develop It</span></a>&nbsp;is
an international educational program that helps women learn to code. It
focuses on networking and keeps women involved in its community in many
awesome ways, including mentoring, which is crucial for retaining women
in the workplace. These projects, along with taking part in for-profit
open source projects, can help a developer maintain visibility in the
workplace effectively without requiring that a developer engage on a
40-hour-a-week basis.</p>
<p>The OSS community structure inherently provides enormous flexibility
so that individuals can determine the time and extent of their
contributions. In theory, there should be even more women engaged in
open source development as opposed to the enterprise, because there is
less dictating of one's schedule by an outside party.</p>
<h3>Open source jobs bring balance</h3>
<p>
If anything, women working in OSS have more balance than those in law
or medicine. In open source, I think it's easier to have kids and still
take time to contribute to projects. You can take time out to travel.
You can take time out to devote yourself to hobbies, whether it&rsquo;s
pursuing a challenging academic project or learning to climb. It&rsquo;s
possible to keep your skills sharp and also take care of raising kids.
From what I've seen, many women who do work in OSS have balanced lives,
happy relationships, and rich social lives. It&rsquo;s an appealing model for
women to shape their lives.</p>
<p>Women can pursue a career in open source software engineering at any
stage in their lives&mdash;from college to mid-career and beyond. As
mentioned, there&rsquo;s room for beginners in many open source projects, and
some, such as the <a title="website" style="letter-spacing: 0px;" href="https://drupal.org/" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);">Drupal</span></a>&nbsp;community
are very adept at onboarding people who have no prior OSS experience.
The annual Python convention now offers childcare, which is rare among
non-open source technical conferences.</p>
<p>When I was working as a Senior Vice President at AOL, a woman once
walked with me to the train to chat about how to manage her career. She
said that until she&rsquo;d met me she didn&rsquo;t know that it was possible to be a
technical executive and also be a mom. She had ruled out having kids in
order to advance her career in technology. That floored me, because the
perception is incorrect. Being in OSS tech<em style="letter-spacing: 0px;">and </em>having kids is great.</p>
<h3>Everybody wins</h3>
<p>
When fewer than 2% of commits are coming from women, strong
contributors are being left on the sidelines. Many project leaders care
about the issue of gender balance intellectually, but overlook the real
impact of failing to attract women to their projects. Projects have
broad access to swaths of male engineers with varying degrees of talent;
the best engineers could be the women that are being left off of the
table. By not engaging women in open source projects teams are leaving
20% of professional developers unengaged. You can&rsquo;t assure yourself that
you&rsquo;ve attracted the best engineering talent to your project if you&rsquo;re
looking at having less than a handful of women contributing.</p>
<p>Having more women engage in open source projects makes it easier to
surface all the available talent in the pool. It also makes it more fun
for the other women considering contributions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more fun to go to Pycon when you know that the Pyladies are
sponsoring a mani-pedi offsite. It&rsquo;s easier to find out what&rsquo;s going on
in the Drupal community when someone like Angela Byron is reaching out a
hand and making everyone feel welcome. Ponying up and contributing
talents to CodeMontage is just all around better when Vanessa Hurst is
meeting you halfway with a smile. Getting more women engaged in open
source means that it&rsquo;s better for the women contributing and results in
more engaged committers contributing code. At the end of the day, you
just want the best projects and the best code you can get, and having
more engaged women is part of getting there.</p>
