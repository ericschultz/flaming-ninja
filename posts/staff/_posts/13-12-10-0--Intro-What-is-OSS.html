<p><em><em>This post is the first in a&nbsp;series that will explore why businesses should become active participants in open source communities. We&rsquo;ll&nbsp;explore what open source is, the&nbsp;economics of OSS (open source&nbsp;software),&nbsp;who uses it, how to make projects&nbsp;successful, and how to participate in external projects. It will also taken a deep dive into more complex topics such as the commercialization of FOSS, community vs customers, managing inbound IP, licenses, software&nbsp;hygiene, and when NOT to publish a project.</em></em></p>
<p><em>S</em>oftware is surprisingly dynamic.&nbsp;All software evolves.&nbsp;Bugs are found and fixed. Enhancements are added.&nbsp;New requirements are discovered in using the software.&nbsp; New uses are found for it, and it is shaped to those new uses. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether the software under discussion is an internal IT project, a commercial proprietary product or a collaborative public software project that is liberally licensed.
</p>
<p>Creating good software is hard work. People have shared software and collaborated on its creation for as long as it has existed, all the way back through conferences run by the computer vendors (e.g. DEC and DECUS, IBM and SHARE). The rise of the Internet and the World Wide Web has removed the friction of calendars and location from these collaborative efforts, accelerating the sharing and collaboration that has always existed. &nbsp; </p>
<p>During the 1970s and 1980s the University of California, Berkeley and MIT were central in liberally licensing software that they developed collaboratively with the computer vendors, and the licenses they defined are still in use today. The X Windows System and the Berkeley UNIX system variations were all developed and licensed this way. </p>
<p>In the mid-1980s, Richard Stallman developed a definition for software freedom as a way to license and publish software as a public good. The definition is focused on a set of freedoms a software user must have.&nbsp; Stallman pioneered a software copyright license called the General Public License (GPL). The GPL continues to evolve under the auspices of the <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation (FSF)</a>, a non-profit organization he created to promote software freedom. The FSF maintains a list of other licenses that support its definition of free software, and an excellent discussion on how the GPL interacts with other liberal licenses. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the late 1990s, a group of commercially-focused individuals assembled to debate and define a description and terminology for these disparate efforts to license collaboratively-developed software, and the <a href="http://opensource.org/osd">Open Source Definition (OSD)</a> was born. It specifies a set of attributes that a software license must support to be considered an open source software license. This led to the formation of the <a href="http://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative (OSI)</a>, a non-profit organization that maintains the OSD and decides whether liberal software licenses meet the definition. The OSD was designed to encompass the free software definition, but goes beyond it. In other words, all free software can be considered open source software (OSS), but not all open source licensed software supports the FSF definition of software freedom.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So free and open source software (FOSS) is a licensing mechanism on software.&nbsp; It encourages the use and re-use of software. Much of the history of software development and software engineering is focused on reliably creating good software, and most would agree that software re-use in all its guises is a good thing. When you use OSS licensing with well-organized collaborative software communities, you create the right conditions to make this use, re-use, and dynamic evolution of software successful.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This guide is organized into three sections. The first begins by exploring the economics of why shared collaboration works, goes on to explain how individuals buy, use, and make FOSS, and concludes with a discussion of how companies can make FOSS. The second section &nbsp;delves into greater detail about the development of successful open source projects, communities, and products.&nbsp; The third and final section presents a discussion about how FOSS foundations enable the growth of FOSS projects.&nbsp; </p>
