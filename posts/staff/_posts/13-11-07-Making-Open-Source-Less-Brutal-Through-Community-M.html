<p>Google&rsquo;s Director of Open Source Chris DiBona <a href="http://opensource.com/business/13/10/interview-chris-dibona">recently said</a> that open source is &ldquo;brutally harsh and exclusionary&rdquo; of developers that don&rsquo;t pull their own weight. That&rsquo;s true, but the community mechanics of collaboration, communication, culture and teamwork and an easy onramp can also encourage better code contributions. </p>
<p>Open source teams are disparate, distributed, and diverse. That&rsquo;s why effective community management is such an important consideration for project leaders. The objective is to produce a strong sense of belonging for every participating developer. </p>
<p>We recently outlined how, in a blog post by our former technical director Stephen Walli. He <a href="/Blogs/EntryId/74/Building-a-Better-Developer-Community-Webinar-Wrap-up">wrote</a> about the importance of strong communications channels for the people who are doing the work, and how governance helps to structure teams so developers align their interests with the project. Collaboration is another important element where different contributors should be given the right tools for their task. Development, documentation, and art and design are all different disciplines. </p>
<p>There are also the intangibles. Your project environment sets the tone for common purpose that will move you toward your next milestone. Community management helps to set the mission and coordinate teams so that everyone pulls their weight. </p>
<p>Mission statements, social contracts, and codes-of-conduct are important cornerstones for building a strong community. A simple governance model that provides for common community processes is the social scaffolding for collaboration. Governance enables your top contributors to get things done and break deadlocks. The governance model must adapt to the state of the community. </p>
<p>&ldquo;In this age of rapid response across many different mediums, there will be times when &hellip; civility may deteriorate.&nbsp;&nbsp;During these times, when emotions may be charged, it is important for the project leadership to remain cool, reinforce the mission of the project, and address the disruption. Having a simple set of guidelines for mailing list and forum posts need not be onerous, rather based on common sense such as the&nbsp;<a href="http://opensource.org/codeofconduct" target="_blank">Code of Conduct for OSI Mailing Lists</a>. If you don't have one, collaborate with your community to create one, increasing the likelihood they will respect it,&rdquo; <a href="/Blogs/EntryId/73/How-to-Build-a-Better-Developer-Community">wrote</a> former Outercurve director Paula Hunter. </p>
<p>Another aspect of building a community is to make it easy to discover, install, and configure the software. Some downloaders eventually <a href="/Blogs/EntryId/88/The-Math-of-FOSS-Freeloaders-Why-Freeloaders-are-Essential-to-FOSS-Project-Success">become contributors</a>, so it should also be easy to bring new ones on board. Users are key to self-sustaining OSS. </p>
<p>Your community shouldn&rsquo;t be exclusionary despite the sometimes brutal nature of the open source world.</p>
