<p>The ChronoZoom project leaders have <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/msr_er/archive/2013/12/02/chronozoom-offers-new-tools-for-history-teachers.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0#Curriculum">announced</a> curriculum modules for K-12 educators to make teaching history more creative and interactive. It uses custom timelines and lesson plan templates to immerse students in pivotal world events. </p>
<p>Microsoft Research (MSR), the University of California Berkeley, and Moscow University created ChronoZoom to help uncover the crosscurrents of history that exist among disparate data sets &ndash; a capability that makes it easier to study &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_History">Big History</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp;ChronoZoom displays these insights on a timeline that reveals interrelations throughout geography, culture and history, as well as across multiple disciplines of academic research. Now, Big History is small enough for high schools. </p>
