<p><em>This post is the seventh in a series that will explore why businesses should become active participants in open source communities. We&rsquo;ll explore what open source is, the economics of OSS (open source software), who uses it, how to make projects successful, and how to participate in external projects. It will also taken a deep dive into more complex topics such as the commercialization of FOSS, community vs customers, managing inbound IP, licenses, software hygiene, and when NOT to publish a project.</em> </p>

<em>Start from the beginning: <a href="/Blogs/EntryId/112/0-Intro-What-is-OSS">Intro.&nbsp; What is it?</a></em></em> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Which open source or free software license should I choose for my project?<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&rdquo; Many people encounter OSS for the first time through a licensing discussion.&nbsp; It can be confusing as there are on the order of 60 licenses that have been approved by the Open Source Initiative as upholding the Open Source Definition.&nbsp; There is an even larger collection of licenses that developers have used that are variations on these licenses, created because the developer felt obliged to expand on an idea or to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; a clause.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to tackle this subject two ways.&nbsp; First, we will start with a very brief introduction to the bare essentials. </p>
<h2>The Bare Essentials </h2>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li><em>Copyright law in the U.S. and many other countries protects software. </em></li>
    <li><em>Anyone that wrote the software owns the copyright and can say how it is used.&nbsp; [NOT saying how it can be used does NOT remove one&rsquo;s responsibility as the owner, even if they don't care.]</em></li>
    <li><em>People sometimes give up their copyright ownership to the software they write in their employment agreements.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></li>
    <li><em>If one wants to liberally share one&rsquo;s software with others so they can use it for anything, there are a few well-accepted SIMPLE licenses (</em><a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0"><em>Apache 2.0</em></a><em>, </em><a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause"><em>BSD</em></a><em>, </em><a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"><em>MIT</em></a><em>).&nbsp; These essentially say: </em>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0in; list-style-type: circle;">
        <li><em>Do whatever you want with the software. </em></li>
        <li><em>Don't claim my work as your own.</em></li>
        <li><em>Do give me credit for my work.</em></li>
        <li><em>THIS SOFTWARE COMES WITH NO WARRANTIES, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.</em><em> <br />
        </em></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><em>It takes about two minutes each to read the </em><a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0"><em>Apache 2.0</em></a><em>, </em><a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause"><em>Berkeley</em></a><em>, and </em><a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"><em>MIT</em></a><em> licenses.&nbsp; These three licenses are good enough for one of the most successful collaborations we have witnessed in the short history of software development (Apache), and for two institutions for higher learning recognized for their contributions to computer and software technology.&nbsp; <br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Lawyers that understood software copyright law and liberally sharing software wrote these licenses.&nbsp; Apache Software Foundation projects are powering the growing business ecosystems of cloud computing, and have successfully powered the rise of the web for 15 years.&nbsp; No lawyer you hire will do better a better job creating a new license than was done with these well-understood well-accepted licenses. <br />
</em></p>
<p><em>If a developer cares about software freedom, then they should be well familiar with the excellent Free Software Foundation </em><a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"><em>essays</em></a><em>, and can consider using the </em><a href="http://opensource.org/licenses"><em>GNU licenses</em></a><em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
</em></p>
<p><em>If a developer or business is trying to "make money" from the software they created or has need to be concerned about software patents, then they need to involve a lawyer in the business,&nbsp;or spend enough time learning about the business tools available to protect software assets as intellectual property.&nbsp; A very good reference for developers is Van Lindberg's </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Intellectual-Property-Open-Source-Protecting/dp/0596517963"><em>Intellectual Property and Open Source</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em> </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the entire introduction.&nbsp; Now for a little more detail. </p>
<h2>Three Big Levers</h2>
<p>The first and obvious consideration for license choice is whether or not the Open Source Initiative (OSI) approves the license as an open source license. As we saw, the OSI created the <a href="http://opensource.org/osd">Open Source Definition</a> in the late 1990s as a set of attributes that a software license must support to be considered &ldquo;open source&rdquo;. Anyone can take a license to the OSI for debate and discussion and if approved as meeting the OSD, then the license can be added to <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/index.html">the canonical list</a>. </p>
<p>While this seems an obvious place to start, a surprising number of people still try to modify these licenses or come up with their own.&nbsp; Difficulty arises because it is now a non-standard license and readers need to understand the essence of the change and why it was needed.&nbsp; Considering the breadth of existing OSI approved licenses, and the creative variations of business models that already exist using these licenses, it is a reach to believe something new needs to be created.&nbsp; There exists a broad collection of OSI-approved licenses today. These licenses cover millions of lines of software involved in billions of dollars in procurement. &nbsp;One would be hard pressed to describe a serious set of circumstances that isn&rsquo;t already covered by an OSI-approved license. </p>
<p>There are several big levers available when considering an open source license: </p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in; list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>How much license reciprocity is required with respect to the software, modifications, and any derivatives someone develops?</li>
    <li>What is said about patent licensing and litigation?</li>
    <li>What legal jurisdiction covers the license? </li>
</ul>
<h2>Reciprocity</h2>
<p>The reciprocity issue is all about <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">&ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;</a> and whether or not using the software source code attaches the license to the modifications and derivatives, and whether the source code to those modifications and derivatives needs to be published. </p>
<p>On one end of the spectrum are licenses that have no copyleft requirements. These licenses essentially allow anyone to use the software in anyway without requiring much more than maintaining copyrights. Licenses that fall into this set include the New and Simplified BSD licenses, the MIT license, and the Apache 2.0 and Microsoft Permissive licenses. </p>
<p>There are licenses that maintain a sense of copyleft around the software itself but support the use of the software in larger works of software that may contain software that is licensed differently (e.g. closed and proprietary). These licenses include the Eclipse Public License, the newer Mozilla Public License 2.0, and the Microsoft Reciprocal License. </p>
<p>On the other end of the copyleft spectrum are strong copyleft licenses. <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Software freedom</a> is defined by the Free Software Foundation in terms of the freedoms a user of software must have. Strong copyleft supports software freedom. Many developers support software freedom, and demonstrate this support using one of the family of GPL licenses (GPL2.0, GPL3.0, and the Affero GPL3.0) as a way to ensure the strongest copyleft and strongest license attachment when the software in question is used in building and distributing other software. </p>
<h2>Patents</h2>
<p>Software patents weren&rsquo;t really an issue when software was beginning to be widely shared on the early Internet and so weren&rsquo;t mentioned in the early licenses. By the late 1990s, software patents were on the rise and corporate legal teams were becoming more involved in the writing of open source licenses as they became more involved with open source software and developing the open source foundations around evolving projects. The Apache 2.0 License, Mozilla Public License 2.0, Eclipse Public License, the newer GPL licenses, and both Microsoft licenses reflect this shift in language. Each license explicitly talks about patent licenses. Each license has language that covers patent litigation to varying degrees.&nbsp; That said, one can still use the MIT or BSD licenses on a project, and offer a separate license for patents if one isn&rsquo;t happy with the nuanced approach to software patents discussed in the other licenses.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Legal Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>Legal jurisdiction is in the big levers category because some licenses explicitly mention it and this can be a real showstopper for some people. &nbsp;The Mozilla Public License 2.0 specifically tries to deal with jurisdiction as one of changes from the original MPL, as that was often a criticism of the earlier license. </p>
<h2>Other Licensing Considerations</h2>
<p>Other considerations choosing a license include: </p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in; list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Are there project specific affinities?</li>
    <li>History of the license and foundation/corporate/commercial involvement?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;The &ldquo;language&rdquo; projects (Perl, PHP, Python) each have their own licenses (Artistic License 2.0, PHP License 3.0, and Python License 2.0 respectively). If working on a project that closely ties to a specific open source programming language community then one should obviously consider that community&rsquo;s license as the question of mixing modules and dependencies will be simplified with respect to open source license. </p>
<p>As software IP law has evolved and the Internet has become an enormous space for people to collaborate on software development, commercial organizations became involved. We have seen the creation of open source software foundations with specific licenses associated with them. Corporate legal teams have become involved in authoring open source licenses, and the language and structure of these licenses (e.g. terminology and definitions) reflects this involvement. Lawyers without a lot of experience in open source licenses may feel more comfortable reviewing these newer licenses. </p>
<p>It is the nature of IP law that the owner of the property can license it as many ways to as many people as they choose. This is why the Microsoft EULA for a personal copy of the Windows operating system is different from an Enterprise License Agreement and how MySQL AB developed a line of business around closed software licensing as well as their GPL-licensed project. In the early days (up through PHP3), the software from the PHP project was similarly &ldquo;dual&rdquo; licensed under both the GPL2.0 and an earlier PHP license to allow the software to be included in as many places as possible because the GPL was not directly compatible with the PHP license of the time. </p>
<p>One could try create a table or decision tree for license choice here, but there are sufficient edges and nuances to license choice that it can never be properly &ldquo;automated&rdquo; with the licenses we have today that reflect their rich background of needs and history. There is always one more legal question of &ldquo;what about the situation when ...?&rdquo; Such questions will likely involve legal counsel and may be very jurisdiction sensitive, so a decision tree approach is tricky at best.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Likewise, open source software licenses don&rsquo;t simply reflect a set of legal choices. In the early stage of an open source project when the author or authors are first publishing the software, the choice of license reflects as much of the social contract that is being made for the project as any legal requirements. It is the first governance document of the early possible community that comes into play long before formal governance, mission statements, and codes of conduct may be created around growing community. </p>
