<p>Being an open source foundation gives us an understanding of the latest developments and trends. There are a lot of popular projects &ndash; especially in cloud and Web development &ndash; but the common denominator is the value that foundations can provide to manage communities and enable code contributions. </p>
<p>Some cloud and Web development projects that are gaining traction include Node.js, Open Stack, and many others that are popular on GitHub. </p>
<p>Revelations of NSA spying have arguably benefited companies that work with open source software in cloud computing by making it possible for them to market themselves as remedies to the intrusion. There&rsquo;s been <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/open-source-software/the-nsas-other-victim-us-business-competitiveness-233001">pushback</a> by enterprises that are now wondering if their data are as safe in the cloud as they&rsquo;ve been led to believe. </p>
<p>Open hardware is another trend that&rsquo;s changing the industry. Companies from <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/facebook-open-sources-its-server-data-center-designs-hardware-fallout-to-follow/47045">Facebook</a> to <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/cloud/infrastructure-as-a-service/microsoft--makes-azure-server-design-open-source/d/d-id/1113617">Microsoft</a> have joined the Open Compute project over the past 2-3 years to reduce their operating costs with a shift toward commodity pricing, eliminating proprietary stacks, and raising confidence in cloud infrastructure. </p>
<p>Open Stack, a cloud-computing platform, has become a juggernaut. It has the support of over <a href="http://www.openstack.org/foundation/companies/">200 companies</a>, and a staff of over 1,000. It&rsquo;s difficult to see how any one company &ndash; no matter how big &ndash; can compete with that level of diversity. But managing that diversity requires project governance. </p>
<p><strong>Making big projects work</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Governance is one way a foundation can enable OSS innovation. Open Stack serves as its own foundation, and openly <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance">publishes</a> its project governance. It even <a href="https://www.openstack.org/blog/category/governance/">blogs</a> about its governance model, which has evolved to <a href="http://fnords.wordpress.com/2013/06/20/history-of-openstack-governance/">empower</a> individual contributors. It began as a project that had two major sponsors. </p>
<p>Foundations establish governance and structure teams so that developers can align their interests with the project.&nbsp;Successful open source governance makes it clear for contributors to understand how to <a href="/Blogs/EntryId/110/Making-Open-Source-Less-Brutal-Through-Community-Management">engage</a>, what&rsquo;s expected of them, and what protections that they have. A good <a href="/Blogs/EntryId/55/Guest-post-Open-Development-by-Ross-Gardler">governance model</a> provides the social framework for collaboration, and is key to project success. </p>
<p>Community norms will eventually change. Open Stack recognized its need to adapt its governance model as the project became more diversified. Some other projects are now experiencing this same issue. Node.jsis is one example of a maturing community that has gone from a single sponsor to many. The appropriate governance model can help to manage its new contributors. </p>
<p>Community relations are an intangible that&rsquo;s equally as important. Many projects on GitHub are now <a href="/Blogs/EntryId/99/Your-License-Is-Your-Interface">struggling</a> with how to navigate structuring their projects as they grow in popularity. Code contributions are one thing, but having the specialization to understand community issues is another challenge that&rsquo;s best left to foundations, which have the tools and resources to support collaboration. </p>
<p>Foundations can establish a more effective way to structure projects. We&rsquo;ve written extensively about how to build OSS, and community development is essential. The structural issues of license, forge, and governance should be spelled out, even if governance becomes an evolving discussion over time.</p>
