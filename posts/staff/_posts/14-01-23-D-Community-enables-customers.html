<p><em>This post is the ninth in a series that will explore why businesses should become active participants in open source communities. We&rsquo;ll explore what open source is, the economics of OSS (open source software), who uses it, how to make projects successful, and how to participate in external projects. It will also taken a deep dive into more complex topics such as the commercialization of FOSS, community vs customers, managing inbound IP, licenses, software hygiene, and when NOT to publish a project. </em></p>
<p><em>Read the previous post:<a href="http://www.outercurve.org/Blogs/EntryId/130/C-Constructing-open-source-software"> Constructing open source software</a><br />
Start from the beginning: <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/Blogs/EntryId/112/0-Intro-What-is-OSS">Intro.&nbsp; What is it?</a><strong></strong></em></p>
<p>Earlier, we discussed the motivation for making open source software, and additional considerations if one was a commercial organization. &nbsp;This section digs a little deeper into the traps that can catch a company when it makes open source and needs to consider both its community and its commercial success with customers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Before we had Internet-sized bandwidth on which to collaborate around software, traditional software business looked something like the first diagram. R&amp;D delivered product. Marketing delivered messages. Sales and marketing managed and qualified leads through a pipeline and if the product solved a customer problem properly, a market was made and you could measure the profits. </p>
<p><img alt="" width="531" height="397" src="/img/old/blog/ch.dimg1.gif" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Internet happened, dramatically removing friction from the process of collaborative software development and delivery. We saw the rise of liberally licensed collaborative projects. &nbsp; </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Companies began to form around some of the projects and for the past decade and a half there's been confusion as people debated either how to make money when you give away the software, or the other side of the economic equation around variations on why people work for free. This has unfortunately led to the idea of community and customer interaction akin to the following diagram. The community is jammed into the middle of the customer pipeline. The community hopefully contributes to R&amp;D, which still delivers product. Marketing now messages to customers AND [worse] the community, and the company tries to "convert" the community into customers. </p>
<p><img alt="" width="524" height="392" src="/img/old/blog/ch.dimg2.gif" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>This probably started around the time that MySQL AB observed they had a paying customer for every thousand downloads. This idea mis-set expectations in a fundamental way. People assumed causality. It created false metrics around driving downloads and improving conversion rates. &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Marten Mickos (while CEO at MySQL) observed that the early community has time but no money while the later community has money but no time, and that his customers are in the latter bucket. This is the start of a better model for understanding community and customer. Let's use the "time is money" line as the division between community and customers because by forcing the separation of the two groups we can add clarity to both and the things a business would need to do differently with each. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Instead lets treat the community (time but no money) as a completely separate entity from the customer pipeline (money but no time). The community members engage with R&amp;D over the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">project</span>. They engage with marketing in a conversation about project direction, and ancillary things like translations in other markets. Customers are qualified through the pipeline based upon the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">product</span>.</p>

<p>Indeed you can start to see how to think about these different groups of people using different well understood and documented processes for <a href="http://www.artofcommunityonline.org/">community development</a> and <a href="http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/sales-marketing-machine/jboss-example/">sales channel management</a>. </p>

</p>
<p>This allows you to clearly address each group's selfish needs. </p>

<p>Product for customers is clearly differentiated from project and community. How the product is differentiated depends upon the company and the value proposition to customers. At it's simplest, the product may be a supportable and maintained collection of software, certified to run on specific supported platforms and with particular applications, and trivially installable. The product may be the support and maintenance itself. Some companies pack more "enterprise ready" marketable differentiated features or attributes into the product. Others (e.g. Red Hat, JBoss, MySQL) develop a valuable network subscription that includes support, maintenance, certifications, additional warranties, monitoring, indemnifications, and the like into a single subscription model. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Regardless, there is well-defined value that solves a customer's problems. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Companies like Alfresco, Hyperic and JBoss all saw conversions in the pipeline because potential customers came to the web site, learned what they needed to learn, downloaded the appropriate things to try, and used the community as a litmus test of the solution before returning (self-qualified) to buy product. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As discussed earlier [link back], a developer community provides enormous value regardless of source licensing strategies and software project collaboration.&nbsp; This is the real "conversion". The community enables customers. &nbsp;It is correlative not causative. Community members that have solved their problems using your technology base will carry their excitement, knowledge, and commitment into new places where customers exist. With well-organized open source communities, the community now fronts your technology to new customers as well as later anchoring customers once they exist.</p>
