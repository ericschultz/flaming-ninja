I am very happy to announce the WiX toolset has been contributed to the Outercurve Foundation. The project has been a special case in Microsoft for a long time. WiX was the first open source project begun at Microsoft. We began as an internal &lsquo;community project&rsquo; in 1999 and released WiX as the first true open source project from Microsoft in 2004. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>The WiX toolset creates Windows Installer packages (.MSI, .MSM, .MSP, etc.) from XML source code. The toolset integrates seamlessly into typical developer processes via command-line tools and Visual Studio integration. The project also extends the Windows Installer to support install applications on IIS, SQL, and other Microsoft platforms. The primary goal of the project is to promote best practices for creating installation packages on Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the 2004 release, the WiX toolset has become recognized as one of the best ways to create installation packages for Windows. Today there are 10,000+ downloads every month. WiX is one of few open source projects shipping with multibillion-dollar software.  It&rsquo;s used in Microsoft Office, SQL Server, Visual Studio and many others inside and outside of Microsoft. Developers are our implementers. The project has an active user mailing list with thousands of participants.</p>
<p>Moving WiX from the Microsoft umbrella to join the foundation speaks to the way Microsoft does OSS projects today. From our first official release in 2004 until 2009 (when Microsoft became a founding sponsor of the Outercurve Foundation) the company has learned a lot about how to participate in the open source community. I like to think that Microsoft now sounds credible when it talks about OSS and that the WiX toolset was a small part of that learning experience.</p>
