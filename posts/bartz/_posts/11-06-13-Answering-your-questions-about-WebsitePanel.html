<p>I’m Bradley Bartz, the project lead for WebsitePanel at Outercurve. I’m also a Microsoft program manager working on the Web Platform and Tooling team.<br />
<br />
I’d like to help answer some of the questions that have been raised on the project <a target="_blank" href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wspsupport/">forum</a>. We (Microsoft) remain committed to supporting WebsitePanel and contributing to the project.<br />
<br />
We will be officially releasing 1.2.0 in July. This release includes the following features:</p>

<p><br />
WebsitePanel has generated a tremendous amount of interest and is being adapted by several ISVs for their customers. Over time I expect some of this work to be contributed back to the project.<br />
<br />
Ryan Jones is a project manager at Microsoft who is helping to coordinate these community contributions.<br />
<br />
Pavel Tsurbeleu is the primary developer from Microsoft contributing to this project. He’s an active contributor on the WebsitePanel forums at <a target="_blank" href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wspsupport/">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wspsupport/</a>. Please feel free to contact him directly let him know if there are specific issues you’d like to have resolved before it’s released.<br />
<br />
In addition to Pavel, Ryan and myself, we have other resources supporting WebsitePanel. We are committed to enhancing the experience of the WebsitePanel community.<br />
<br />
As we plan the next release I’d like to learn more about the features that are important to you. If you would like to contribute to the WebsitePanel project, please contact Ryan or myself at the email addresses blow.<br />
<br />
Thank you for investing in Website Panel and helping to keep this a vibrant community.<br />
