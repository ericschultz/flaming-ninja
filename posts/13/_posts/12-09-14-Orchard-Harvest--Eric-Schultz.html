<p>I was fortunate to be invited to speak at <a href="http://harvest.orchardproject.net/">Harvest</a>, the first annual <a href="http://www.orchardproject.net/">Orchard</a> conference in Santa Monica last weekend. At around 70 attendees, Harvest exceeded expectations for the number of participants but it was small enough where all the participants felt connected. Spread out over Saturday and Sunday, the conference brought together a diverse (more on that later) and eager Orchard community.
</p>
<h3>Saturday
</h3>
<p>Some of the highlights for me from the first day were:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A keynote from Orchard Benevolent Dictator Bertrand Le Roy (<a href="http://twitter.com/bleroy">@bleroy</a>) and Orchard board member S&egrave;bastien Ros (<a href="https://twitter.com/sebastienros">@sebastienros</a>) reflecting on the past and present of Orchard.
    </li>
    <li>S&egrave;bastien Ros shared the future of Orchard which included an introduction to <a href="https://github.com/sebastienros/yessql">YesSQL</a>. YesSQL is a library for using any transactional RMDBS as a data-store for NoSQL-style database (Think <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">Mongo DB</a> using a <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> database as its storage mechanism). Once YesSQL is stable, it will be used for Orchard.
    </li>
    <li>Brett Morrison (<a href="https://twitter.com/morrisonbrett">@morrisonbrett</a>) of <a href="http://www.onestop.com/">OneStop Internet</a> and Betrand showed different approaches of using Orchard in commerce. Bertrand's company <a href="http://nwazet.com/">[Nwazet</a> uses Orchard and custom Orchard modules for managing [Nwazet's web store. Brett showed how OneStop integrated legacy ASP.NET WebForms code with Orchard as part of a gradual migration to their next generation platform built on top of Orchard.
    </li>
    <li>After a short lunch break, Sipke Schoorstra (<a href="https://twitter.com/sfmskywalker">@sfmskywalker</a>), Orchard board member, described the main Orchard APIs developers could use in module development. Using the APIs shared, developers can customize Orchard to fit their unique needs.
    </li>
    <li>Finally, Piotr Szmyd (<a href="https://twitter.com/pszmyd">@pszmyd</a>) discussed the ways in which developers can localize their applications. Localization and internationalization are always difficult but Piotr shared best practices for localizing a web site using Orchard and Orchard modules.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Sunday
</h3>
<p>After an evening get-together, the second day started bright and early at 9 AM. Some of the highlights of the second day included:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>I presented on what Outercurve does for the Orchard community and how we'd like to help going forward. Attendees provided a number of suggestions about what I can do to help support the Orchard community.
    </li>
    <li>Arra Derderian (<a href="https://twitter.com/arraderderian">@arraderderian</a>) discussed his experience organizing the <a href="http://orchardcmsboston.org/">Boston Orchard CMS User Group</a> and his recommendations for organizing local Orchard user groups.
    </li>
    <li>S&egrave;bastien Ros discussed theming including when features should be integrated into a theme versus a module.
    </li>
    <li>Pete Hurst provided a case study using the <a href="http://orchardmediagarden.codeplex.com/">Media Garden module</a> to organize and present different types of media.
    </li>
    <li>Bertrand Le Roy discussed projections in Orchard. With projections, administrators can create complex queries of CMS content for internal use or for presenting to the end user.
    </li>
    <li>S&egrave;bastien Ros shared tips on performance and deployment of Orchard sites. Included in his presentations were recommendations for sites in shared hosting, sites on a dedicated box and sites deployed to Windows Azure.
    </li>
    <li>Zolt&aacute;n Leh&oacute;czky (<a href="https://twitter.com/zlehoczky">@zlehoczky</a><a href="https://twitter.com/lehoczkyz"></a>), the co-founder of the <a href="http://english.orchardproject.hu/">Hungarian Orchard community</a>, fought through keyboard trouble and a persistent cough to give a great presentation. He illustrated best practices for search engine optimization of Orchard sites using a set of modules including the <a href="http://gallery.orchardproject.net/List/Modules/Orchard.Module.SH.GoogleAnalytics">Google Analytics module</a> and the <a href="http://gallery.orchardproject.net/List/Modules/Orchard.Module.WebAdvanced.Sitemap">Advanced Sitemap module</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Benedek Farkas, the other co-founder of the Hungarian Orchard community, discussed what features of a legacy CMS can be automatically migrated to Orchard using the <a href="http://gallery.orchardproject.net/List/Modules/Orchard.Module.Orchard.ImportExport">Import Export module</a> and what must be migrated by hand.
    </li>
    <li>At the end of talks on Sunday, the Harvest members participated in the Orchard Harvest Hackathon. Ylan Kunstler (<a href="https://twitter.com/ylank">@ylank</a>) expressed the excitement of the Hackathon best:

<h3>Final thoughts
</h3>
<p>The diversity of the participants at the conference was impressive. Participants came from Hungary, the United Kingdom, South Africa and from all over the United States. Additionally, approximately 10% of the participants were female. What I found most exciting though was the diversity of experiences in Orchard and in open source software in general among the participants. Some participants are active developers of Orchard and its modules, others were regular users looking to gain experience and others still were there to decide whether Orchard was the right CMS for their projects. Some were regular open source users and contributors, others were only involved in Orchard and others still didn't really understand how open source worked. This variety of experience encouraged collaboration and a sharing of ideas surrounding Orchard that might not have occurred had the attendees been less diverse.
</p>
<p>Even though the participants came from diverse backgrounds, there was one common feeling in the room: excitement. No matter whether they were developers, executives, designers or DBAs, all attendees expressed a genuine enthusiasm at what Orchard can do for them now and what it can do for them in the future. After such successful first Harvest, I'm confident next year's conference will be even better.</p>
