<p>This summer was the first in which the Outercurve Foundation <a href="/Blogs/EntryId/61/Outercurve-and-Its-2012-Summer-of-Code" target="blank">participated</a> as a mentoring organization in <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012" target="blank">Google Summer of Code</a> (GSoC). Two of our projects, <a href="http://coapp.org" target="blank">CoApp</a> and <a href="http://makemayhem.com" target="blank">Mayhem</a>, were assigned a student each as part of GSoC. I had the honor of mentoring <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/cristina-turcan/15/63a/427" target="blank">Cristina Turcan</a> who developed a <a href="https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2012/cristina_sabre/1" target="blank">Package Maker UI for CoApp</a>. As part of GSoC, Google invited mentors, including myself, to come to Mountain View, CA for the GSoC Mentor Summit, held October 20 and 21.

<p>As a first time attendee, I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the Mentor Summit. Would the summit focus on GSoC mentoring or would it be a general free, libre and open source software conference? As it turns out, it was a little of both. Some of the sessions focused on managing GSoC students and mentors but many others focused on cooperation between open source projects. A few of the sessions I attended were:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FOSS 4 Humanity</span> was a meeting of representatives from humanitarian free and open source software projects and interested observers.  A particularly exciting initiative discussed is an effort by humanitarian FOSS projects to refer volunteers to projects that best fit the volunteer's skills. For example, let's say a person with lots of Java experience wanted to volunteer on project written in Python. With the volunteer's permission, the project would refer that person to a project written in Java. In the end, humanitarian projects would get the highest quality volunteers and volunteers would be able to use their skills in the most efficient way possible.
    </li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Open Source &amp; Government</span> brought together mentors involved in projects with potential government uses, government employees who work on open source software and the broader open source community. The participants discussed issues affecting government adoption of and participation in open source software.
    </li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Open Source &amp; Science</span> focused on the best ways to encourage the open sourcing of experiment and analysis code for scientific journal articles. Currently most journals do not require source code be published for any programs written as part of an experiment.  Participants discussed ways to encourage journals to require source code release and create tools to simplify sharing of experiment code and relevant system settings.
    </li>
    <li>I presented as part of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Free software non-profits and umbrella organizations demystified</span> organized by Bradley Kuhn of the <a href="http://sfconservancy.org" target="blank">Software Freedom Conservancy</a> and the Free Software Foundation and Rob Kaye of the <a href="http://metabrainz.org" target="blank">MetaBrainz Foundation</a>. Ulrich St&auml;rk also presented for the <a href="http://apache.org/" target="blank">Apache Foundation</a>. Each of us discussed the pros and cons of associating an open source project with a neutral, non-profit foundation and the differences between each of the foundations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The time spent outside of the sessions was equally rewarding. During meals and break I had the chance to meet people working on important projects that have real life importance. Whether they were working to <a href="http://www.openmonitor.org/" target="blank">expose and document censorship</a>, <a href="http://bloomington.in.gov/open-source" target="blank">improve the quality of government services at a reduced cost</a> or <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="blank">develop tools for complex statistical analysis of data</a>, everyone had the same goal: to work together to improve people's lives. Participants were eager to collaborate with other projects to develop common solutions. With the dedication and excitement shown by the participants, it's impossible to not be optimistic about the future of open source software.</p>
