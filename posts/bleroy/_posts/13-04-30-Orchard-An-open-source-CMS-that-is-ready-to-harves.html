It may not be top of mind for most people yet, but Orchard has rapidly become a robust option for a CMS on the .NET platform. It&rsquo;s free, open source and already powering online stores for major brands. Now, the Orchard project team is on the verge of launching major new media management features that will rival the best-known CMSs.<br />
<p>
</p>
<p>Orchard was originally created by Microsoft and is now maintained by the Outercurve Foundation, a non-profit and IP-neutral open source software foundation. There have been nearly half a million downloads over the past two years. As an example, e-commerce solution provider <a target="_blank" href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fwww.onestop.com%2f&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429">Onestop Internet</a> is using Orchard for key customer engagements with established brands including John Varvatos and Spy Optic.</p>
The critical mass of community support that&rsquo;s forming behind the project has empowered contributors to build extensive new functionality. Version 1.7, which is due in June, introduces a streamlined media manager that integrates slideshows and the ability to easily upload and manage digital content. It will also feature a significant new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fwww.davidhayden.me%2fblog%2forchard-workflow-module&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429">workflow module</a> to manage publishing tasks that is graphical editor, which is also extensible.<br />
<br />
Orchard&rsquo;s new media manager is designed to provide the best user experience out of any .NET-based CMS. &ldquo;Nothing out there combines all these features. We looked at everything that&rsquo;s available, and think we have it as streamlined as possible,&rdquo; said Orchard project leader Bertrand Le Roy. Some specific capabilities are:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>&bull; Rewritten media picker and media management: multiple selection, drag &amp; drop multiple imports with progress bars, integrated web search and import. Emphasis has been put on ease of use and optimal usage of screen real estate with visual cues that are primordial to media management.</p>

<p>&bull; Built-in image processing tools (hue, saturation, crop, Instagram-style presets):</p>

<br />
<blockquote>
&bull; Extensibility: media are now content items that can be extended like anything else in Orchard. This opens the media management to point to local or remote images, videos, documents, etc. The opportunities for third-party extension are huge.<br />
</blockquote>
The workflow module also delivers big changes. Orchard module and theme developer David Hayden recently blogged that, &ldquo;&hellip;the Workflow Module has a drag and drop canvas where you place and connect various events, actions, and decision nodes.&rdquo; He added that the module offers enormous flexibility into how content is created, reviewed, approved, and published, replacing a rules engine.

<br />
Orchard also allows you to build custom modules. It is designed for extensibility with tools that allow developers and customizers to provide additional functionality through modules and themes. An ecosystem of add-ons is forming around Orchard, with over 500 modules and themes available on the gallery, and over 4,000,000 total downloads.<br />
<br />
The new kid in CMS town is gaining a foothold among .NET developers &ndash; so much so that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2feuro2013.orchardharvest.org%2f&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429">Orchard Harvest</a>, the second ever Orchard user conference, is being held in Amsterdam, Netherlands in mid-June. Organizers anticipate that Orchard users from throughout Europe and beyond will be attending.<br />
<br />
Orchard Harvest sessions are focusing on best practices, conversations with core contributors, module development, Web design, as well as several success stories with high volume Web sites and a hackathon.<br />
