<p>As I have been offering my colleagues at the <a href="/Blogs/EntryId/36/Happy-Birthday-Eclipse" target="_blank">Eclipse Foundation</a> and the<a href="http://content.linuxfoundation.org/20th/" target="_blank"> Linux Foundation</a> happy birthday wishes, I realized that here at the Outercurve Foundation, we have recently reached our own milestone of two years running.</p> <p>I am very pleased with the positive momentum we’ve achieved since our launch in the fall of 2009. In two years we’ve gained over <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">175 contributors across 17 projects</b>, with 47% of those developers employed by organizations and companies other than our founding sponsor, Microsoft. I have also noticed that we are establishing diversity in the licenses and forges represented, including <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">GPL, BSD, Apache, Github, Sourceforge and Codeplex</b>, among others. This sends a strong message to the software industry and the FOSS community: Outercurve is truly a technology, platform and license-agnostic organization. We also have a solid pipeline of new projects, and are readying several new initiatives that will support our existing projects and allow us to scale up. <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"><br /></span></p> As a non-profit FOSS foundation (501c6), we provide legal structure, business operations and technical services to a growing collection of FOSS projects. As any startup can attest, the fun stuff is the externally focused work, but in the background, we have been working on tools and best practices to ensure our project leaders are supported by strong IP management practices and community development services. </span>We have overhauled our by-laws to allow for board expansion and to take on new sponsors. And we continue to evaluate new services to streamline our operations and add value to our project teams.</span></p>We do this with a lean staff, including myself and Stephen Walli, our Technical Director, and we supplement with a <a href="http://www.virtualmgmt.com/" target="_blank">Virtual </a>staff that provides us with a professional team to handle business operations, program and financial management. Our intent is to be nimble and scalable.</span></p>You don’t have to look very far to find other successful OSS foundations. Most were formed to support projects - like <a href="http://www.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache </a>- by providing a forum in which development could occur while corporate interest grew. The Apache project evolved into the Apache Software Foundation, much as the Eclipse Project evolved into the Eclipse Foundation. The Linux Foundation evolved out of the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL). With this year’s anniversaries - Linux is 20 years old, and Eclipse is 10 - there is ample proof of the value of open source foundations.</span></p>What I find most interesting as we celebrate the two-year mark is the rich variety of OSS projects which have come our way since 2009. We have platform-focused OSS projects such as <a href="/Galleries/ASPNETOpenSourceGallery/OrchardProject">Orchard</a>, <a href="/Galleries/ASPNETOpenSourceGallery/NuGet">NuGet </a>and <a href="/Galleries/ASPNETOpenSourceGallery/MVCContrib">MVC Contrib</a> as well as industry-focused projects like the bioinformatics research project <a href="/Galleries/ResearchAccelerators/NETBio">.NET Bio</a> and the <a href="/Galleries/DataLanguagesandSystemsInteroperability/GADS">GADS </a>Open Source Project for power generating plant engineers and software developers. We believe the diversity of projects, and the diversity of our committer base, proves our value proposition. </span></p> With 2012 not far off, we look forward to a number of announcements around new and existing projects, programs to better support projects and committers, and new areas of focus. Stay tuned, and participate in the continued growth of the Foundation.</span></p> <p> </p> <p> </p>
