<p>&#160;I want to take a moment and welcome the <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/Galleries/ResearchAccelerators/NETBio">.NET Bio</a> project team to the Outercurve Foundation’s <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/Galleries/ResearchAccelerators">Research Accelerators Gallery</a>.</p>
<p>Formerly known as the Microsoft Biology Foundation, this project enables researchers and scientists to share data and development methodologies to support a range of life sciences research projects.</p>
<p>The .NET Bio project is a language-neutral bioinformatics toolkit built as an extension to the Microsoft .NET Framework. .NET Bio includes parsers for common bioinformatics file formats; algorithms for manipulating DNA, RNA, and protein sequences; and connectors to biological web services, such as NCBI BLAST.</p>
<p>In addition to Microsoft Research contributions, there were several academic and commercial contributions included in the ownership transfer to the Outercurve Foundation. This project is overseen by a technical Advisory Board, including representatives from Cornell, University of Queensland, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Illumina, and the initial sponsor - Microsoft Corporation.</p>
<p>.NET Bio is now in a position to expand its reach across academic, science and research communities, and we wish the team continued success. For questions about the project, <strong>contact the Project Manager: Rick Benge</strong> at: a-rickbe ”at” Microsoft “dot”com.</p>
<p>Simon Mercer, director in the Microsoft Research Connections group, provides an overview of the improvements and features of project on this <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/bio/mbf.aspx">video</a>.</p>
