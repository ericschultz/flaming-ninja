<p>Sometimes when you are on a prolonged search, you find what you are looking right in front of you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For several months now, we have been on the lookout for someone that could help us help our projects grow and succeed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had originally viewed this role as a "community evangelist", and advertised it as so.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While at <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2012">OSCON </a>this year, I was talking to quite a few people on the floor about this position, and had an "aha" moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This isn't a religious issue, this is about helping our projects... they don't need to be preached to, nor do they want us preaching for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;So with all due respect to you evangelists out there, I am happy to announce we have hired Eric Schultz as Outercurve's Developer Advocate.&nbsp; And as Merriam Webster defines it, Eric will be "one that supports or promotes the interests of another".&nbsp; Eric came to us via the <a href="/LinkClick.aspx?link=103&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=431">CoApp project</a>, where he has been an active contributor for some time.</p>
<p>Eric's first order of business is to get to know our project leaders and identify how we can help them across the life cycle of their projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will also see Eric at open source events, and likely contributing code to Outercurve and other OSS projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This fits in with our goal this year to instill more discipline into how we manage and support our broad and diverse community of open source developers.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to reach out to Eric, contact him at eschultz "at" outercurve "dot" org.</p>
<p>Welcome aboard Eric!</p>
