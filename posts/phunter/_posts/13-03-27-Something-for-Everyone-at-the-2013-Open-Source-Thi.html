If you have not ventured to an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.osthinktank.com/events/open-source-think-tank-spring-2013/event-summary-79f2ee0709c548c9ab2f28d0cf90eb69.aspx">Open Source Think Tank</a> (OSTT), I encourage you to participate in one. Spending 2 &frac12; days with this gathering of technical and business executives is a very cost effective way to learn and engage in the ongoing conversation and evolution of open source. The OSTT does request that, &ldquo;participants shall not publicly share individual or specific remarks made by other attendees,&rdquo; so what happens in fight club stays in fight club. My report is absent of names, but you can discern the types of companies and people in attendance by looking at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.osthinktank.com/events/open-source-think-tank-spring-2013/custom-19-79f2ee0709c548c9ab2f28d0cf90eb69.aspx">agenda</a>.  There is no grand conspiracy here, as the organizers attest: &ldquo;The intention behind brainstorming and think tank events are to generate interactive discussions which are honest and open,&rdquo; and I find that participants aren&rsquo;t worried about being in PR mode all the time. That reduces the burden of feeling like you need to be tweeting every great comment, and it&rsquo;s rather liberating.  Some takeaways follow.<br />
<strong><br />
There are still a lot of new entrants out there.</strong><br />
<br />
The number of new faces in the room pleasantly surprises me each year when I attend OSTT.  I would estimate between 20-30% of the participants are attending for the first time, and many of them are spearheading new open source initiatives within their companies. As much as OSS has infiltrated large enterprises, many of these companies have been harvesters rather than active contributors.  I see a growing interest in contributing to open source for two distinct reasons: 1.) the need/desire to give back after being the beneficiary for so long, and 2.) a more complete comprehension of the benefits of this collaborative development model.<br />
<br />
<strong>Where there is open source, there are lawyers.</strong><br />
<br />
I meet new attorneys at each OSTT. Some are gaining insight on open source for the first time; others are some of the most experienced legal minds advocating for open source. A few first time attendees were surprised that there were so many legal professionals here, but I view it as a healthy sign that companies want to understand and embrace open source. The OSTT is one of the best places for these minds to come together.<br />
<strong><br />
Change is hard and it takes a long time.</strong><br />
<br />
Each year, the group listens to a case study from a company or organization that is facing challenges with regard to open source. The challenges can cover governance, community development, internal barriers, industry barriers, and other factors that can impede the success of an open source initiative. Attendees break into groups and workshop the problems and then present (with great competitive flair) their recommendations with some of the brightest and experienced minds in open source. One highlight each year is to hear an update on the prior year&rsquo;s case study. It is fascinating to see what worked and what didn&rsquo;t, but in all cases I have found that as much as everyone wants to succeed, change isn&rsquo;t easy. Organizations reorganize, people move on, momentum stalls. The collaborative and people-centric open source model is what I believe keeps these large and complex organizations moving forward, even if they aren&rsquo;t getting overnight results. The presenters are hopeful, and always eager to solicit new ideas.<br />
<br />
<strong>Riding a bike is as conducive to business discussions as golf.</strong><br />
<br />
Biking was offered as an option for the social time at OSTT this year, and again, I opted for this over golf or vineyard tours. Now, this was not your spandex and high tech bike outing, rather a relaxing tour of the Napa region on 5-speed bikes (the guys got 7 speeds, I grumble). I found that it was easy to have lengthy discussions about open source, how the Outercurve Foundation operates, and how other companies are addressing legal and governance challenges while we gently peddled over 22 miles.   I highly encourage conference organizers to think out of the box on social events, and can attest that the biking was successful and enjoyable on a beautifully sunny California day.<br />
<br />
<strong>There are still too few women engineers and OSS developers.</strong><br />
<br />
This is a recurring theme at every high-tech event that I attend. I admit that one of the first things I do is count the women in the room. There are rarely more that 12-15 women attending, and this held true at OSTT. This is not by any means the fault of the event hosts, as Andrew and Mark are both very welcoming and encouraging, but sadly they draw from a very small pool of women. In a strange way, I often feel guilty hanging with the gals, because there are so few of us, but in many cases this is the one time in a year where I see them. As discouraging as one might find the gender ratio, a more telling data point is the fact that the majority of women in attendance are not software engineers. This holds true at many open source events that I attend. We are business, marketing/PR, legal, and finance executives. Senior women engineers are a rarity in OSS, more so than any other tech sector I have worked in.<br />
<br />
<strong>Foundations remain a viable mechanism for advancing open source projects.</strong><br />
<br />
I am always in good company at the OSTT, and enjoy meeting up with colleagues from Apache, Eclipse, the Linux Foundation, and other non-profits. While we are lightly competitive with one another, it is evident in the diversity and quantity of projects that we oversee that there is plenty of room for all of us. Companies continue to support these organizations for the vital role they play in enabling a neutral place for competitors and partners to collaborate.<br />
<br />
I look forward to the next event this fall.
