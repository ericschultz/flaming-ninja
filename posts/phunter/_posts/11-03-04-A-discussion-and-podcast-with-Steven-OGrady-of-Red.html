<p>I had a discussion with Steven O’Grady of <a href="http://redmonk.com/" target="_blank">RedMonk </a>last week; we talked a lot about what it means to contribute to the Outercurve Foundation. We recorded the conversation, so you can listen to the full discussion or read the highlights below.</p>
<p>There are a variety of FOSS foundations. Some are sponsor-driven foundations such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.opensuse.org/en/">openSUSE</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.openstack.org/"> OpenStack</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://fedoraproject.org/">fedora</a>, and some are community-driven foundations such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.libreoffice.org/download/">LibreOffice </a>and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a>. A hybrid model has evolved which combines the attributes of the two types, and is best represented by foundations such as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>. Outercurve is much like the latter in that we’ve been evolving our governance and structure to merge the needs of sponsors and developers alike.<br />
<br />
The Outercurve Foundation is vendor neutral, plus license and technology agnostic. We achieve this via our legal structure, namely our by-laws. These three features are unique, and they ensure a project is safe from commercial interests; everyone’s on a level playing field.<br />
<br />
I think the feature that makes Outercurve most interesting is the gallery model, which is how we gather related projects together. Similar to a museum, our “works of art” (projects) are collected around a particular theme. No project is accepted into a gallery without careful thought as to how it relates to the overall gallery theme and how it complements the other projects already in the collection.<br />
<br />
Any organization can sponsor a gallery to achieve their defined goals. Thus far, we have created galleries that focus on a specific platform (<a href="/galleries/aspnet">ASP.NET</a> is a good example); foster projects in an industry sector (the <a href="/galleries/research">Research Accelerators</a> Gallery); or solve a technical problem like interoperability (the <a href="/galleries/dlsi">SII </a>Gallery). The gallery model gives a sponsor the ability to develop a theme and choose which projects it accepts, which helps everyone reach their goals - increasing project committer activity, increasing a platform’s usefulness, and building community and common cause.<br />
