It has been a very busy spring for the Mayhem project team, with GSoC applications flying in and plenty of interest in the project, we have decided to extend the deadline for the "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.makemayhem.com/">makemayhem</a>" contest.<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s not too late to enter the contest! The submission deadline has been extended to June 30, 2012! <br />
<br />
If you are a developer, contribute AddOns that extend the Mayhem universe of devices and services that can be connected together and you can have the opportunity to win big in the Make Your Own Mayhem Contest. There are lots of prizes, including (2) USD $1,000 awards. And if you are a true Master of Mayhem, there is the Mayhem Master Award of USD $3,000!<br />
<br />
