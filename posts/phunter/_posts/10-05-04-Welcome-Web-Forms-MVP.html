We have just added a new project to the <a href="/Galleries/ASPNETOpenSourceGallery.aspx">ASP.NET Open Source Gallery</a>.    The <a href="/Galleries/ASPNETOpenSourceGallery/WebFormsMVPProject.aspx">Web Forms MVP project</a> supports test-driven development for ASP.NET applications.     If you are a web developer, or are involved in technical decisions regarding your web platform, you may want to pay attention to this project.</p>
<p><br />
How did this project come about?   The origin of this project resides “down under” in Australia.   Seems two colleagues, Damian Edwards and Tatham Oddie were the original brains of this project, which has gone through a number of revisions.    This project has matured to a point where it is now bundled with DotNetNuke 5.3+, integrated with EPiServer, and is powering large production web sites.  Damian recently took a job with Microsoft, and Tatham agreed to take on the role of project coordinator.  If you are interested in contributing to this project, by all means contact <a href="javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(116,97,116,104,97,109,64,111,100,100,105,101,46,99,111,109,46,97,117)+'?')">Tatham</a>.</p>

A little more detail about Web Forms MVP:   It is a simple-to-implement Model View Presenter framework for ASP.Net Web Forms, and balances productivity and control for developers charged with developing and maintaining ASP.NET applications by providing support for features such as data binding, normal server controls and asynchronous pages.    Of course, all of this and more is detailed at the <a href="http://webformsmvp.com/">project web site</a>.</p>
