I&rsquo;m very pleased to announce the Outercurve Foundation has signed its second sponsor. AOL, a web and e-commerce pioneer, will work with Outercurve to facilitate the organization&rsquo;s efforts to open-source internally developed projects.<br />
<br />
Erynn Petersen, AOL SVP of Paid Services Engineering, shepherded AOL through the process of becoming a sponsor. I first met Erynn at the <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fwww.olliancegroup.com%2fabout%2fnewsandevents%2fthinktank%2findex.php&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=431" target="_blank" re_target="_blank">Olliance Open Source Think Tank</a> in April 2011. Erynn presented a case study about two related open source initiatives at AOL: one in which the company was employing open source technologies and practices to improve the innovation and efficiency of AOL developers, and the second, which dealt with giving back to the OSS community by releasing elements of AOL&rsquo;s software portfolio as open source. Erynn challenged Think Tank attendees to follow her path, which she believes has enriched AOL&rsquo;s ability to deliver content to its customers while encouraging the company to contribute to the OSS community. It was a fascinating case study, and led to many animated conversations.<br />
<br />
Erynn manages development teams within AOL which use open source software extensively to support internal development of the company&rsquo;s content delivery platforms and services. She is part development manager, part innovator and part evangelist. We are fortunate to have AOL, and Erynn, join us as a sponsor.<br />
<br />
AOL, with Erynn&rsquo;s guidance, has been able to make contributions at a core level to a number of critical OSS projects while simultaneously shifting its focus to areas of differentiation where it provides new value for customers.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;AOL will benefit as an Outercurve sponsor by transferring our projects to the foundation, which eliminates the complexity of creating, funding and managing a separate foundation,&rdquo; Erynn told me when she made the decision to become a sponsor of the foundation. &ldquo;Outercurve sponsorship also will make it simpler for our partners to contribute to AOL-sponsored open source projects.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
AOL&rsquo;s sponsorship provides yet another example of how Outercurve&rsquo;s model works for businesses and the OSS community.  As a forge, technology, and license-neutral entity we are in a unique position to help corporations contribute projects to the OSS community by providing truly neutral IP management, governance, administrative and operations expertise. I am certain sponsorship of Outercurve will benefit AOL, its developers, and the open source community, and also that Erynn&rsquo;s participation will enrich the foundation and help us improve our processes as we work to provide value to our projects and contributors.<br />
<br />
Erynn has been a great advocate of open source at AOL, as well as a supporter of the greater open source community. We look forward to AOL contributions at the project and gallery level.  <br />
<br />
Stay tuned for great things from AOL and our founding sponsor, Microsoft, as the Outercurve Foundation moves into its third year of success.
