<p>When Sam Ramji delivers a presentation, it typically creates buzz.</p><p>This week was not the exception.&#160; &#160;Sam gave a 30 minute presentation, titled "Microsoft and Open Source:&#160;Beyond Interoperability" and&#160; I would have enjoyed being there.&#160;&#160; Granted I&#160;am biased.</p> <p>Thankfully, for those of you that have inquired, it was video taped and I&#160;will post the full video and audio here on our site when it arrives in my inbox.</p> <p>If you would like me to ping you when I&#160;have it, just send me a <a href="javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(112,104,117,110,116,101,114,64,111,117,116,101,114,99,117,114,118,101,46,111,114,103)+'?subject=Sam's%20video%20for%20eBusiness%20presenation.')">note</a>.</p> <p>&#160;</p>
