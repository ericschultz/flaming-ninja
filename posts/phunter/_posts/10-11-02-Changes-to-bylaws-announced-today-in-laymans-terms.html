<p>Today we announced a set of changes to our <a href="/assets/files/OutercurveFoundationBylaws-2010-10-28.pdf">bylaws</a> which will take us to the next step of opening up the Foundation to a more diverse board of directors and committers. When I came on board in February of this year, we had just announced our first gallery (ASP.NET) and project and were operating under an interim board of directors. Since that time, we have focused on expanding the number of galleries and projects within the foundation, and taking the time to talk with our contributors about what they need across the lifecycle of an open source project in order for their project to be successful.</p>
<p><br />
As I staffed up and reviewed the early analysis of the foundation and our governance model, I realized that I would likely need to make some changes to our operations and bylaws to embrace a broader set of sponsors and projects.</p>
<p>To that end, we hired Andy Updegrove (of<a href="http://www.gesmer.com/home.php"> Gesmer Updegrove, LLP</a>) to assist us in making some of these changes. In the interest of full disclosure, I have been a client of Andy’s before at several other nonprofit consortia and organizations that needed his expertise. Andy has decades of experience with a wide range of groups and has helped many evolve as their mission has expanded and/or changed. We also leveraged the experiences of Jim Jagielski, a current foiundation board member and president of the Apache Software Foundation.</p>
<p>My request to Andy and guidance to the board of directors was to move incrementally. We wanted to make sure we codified a sponsor membership class that would allow others to join the organization and be eligible to influence our strategic direction. We also wanted to ensure our board could grow from the five seats allocate in our old bylaws, and we wanted the board to be diverse and not solely sponsor run.</p>
<p>Andy came up with a terrific idea to form a Technical Advisory Board (TAB), which we will likely phase in next year. The TAB will be comprised of gallery and project leaders and project committers. Once the TAB is in place, participants will over time become eligible to run for seats on the board of directors. (That said, in my experience with non-profit technology organizations, the bulk of contributors don’t want to get caught up with the governance and funding of the entity - but for those who want to influence Outercurve, the opportunity will be there.) The TAB will aid our Technical Director in refining our project acceptance and operations guidelines, best practices, mentorship programs, and other services we offer to our projects. TAB members will also have more access and visibility to the board of directors, providing them with a path onto the board if, in fact, they are interested in running for a seat.</p>
<p>Finally, we wanted to make sure it was absolutely clear that the foundation would support our committers to the same level we support our own board and staff. We have chosen to be direct in our bylaws with regard to our intent to indemnify Outercurve committers. We value their work and contribution to the foundation.</p>
<p>Making changes to the bylaws and governance of the organization was challenging but necessary. With this major goal accomplished, it’s time to turn back to the equally important task of supporting our current galleries and projects. We have an interesting pipeline of potential projects, and more programs to roll out. As always, we are interested in your thoughts on the changes we’ve made, and look forward to your comments.</p>
