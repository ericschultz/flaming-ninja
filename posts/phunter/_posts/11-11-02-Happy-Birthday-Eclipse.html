<p>I read with interest an <a target="_blank" href="http://adtmag.com/Articles/2011/11/01/Happy-10th-Birthday-Open-Source-Eclipse.aspx?Page=1">article </a>today that gave a brief overview of the history of the Eclipse platform.   The author reminded readers that IBM “coughed up” $40 million to get the initiative off the ground… which  sounds like a lot of cash in these austere days,  but 2001 was a different time for high tech. It should be noted that when IBM decides to invest, they can part with serious money (remember the $1B Linux pledge?)</p>
<p>The piece also reminded us that there was no shortage of skeptics during the early days of the project, and it took the formation of the Eclipse Foundation to help allay concerns IBM was not intent on dominating the direction of the technology.   In fact, if you look at the stats today, you will find many projects dominated by IBM, but you can also find projects dominated by Oracle, Actuate, Google,  Red Hat and others.</p>
<p>One of the primary contributors to the growth and diversity of Eclipse was the shift to a non-profit foundation model.  This model increased transparency, established a balanced governance model and leveled the playing field for participation at the individual and corporate level.</p>
<p>With the Outercurve Foundation just wrapping up our second year, I can say we have learned from the Eclipse model, and we quickly adjusted our governance and foundation structure to allow us to evolve into a more diverse organization over time.  We are pleased to be working with over 160 contributors across 17 projects, with 47% of those developers NOT employed by Microsoft - a strong  message to the industry, and a great ROI for Microsoft’s founding membership.    We have a solid pipeline of new projects, and are readying several new initiatives that will support our existing projects and allow us to scale up.</p>
<p>So, congrats Eclipse, and thanks for sharing your experiences and best practices.</p>
