<p>A lot of developers have asked “why would I engage with the CodePlex Foundation”, and I thought it would be good to flesh out some of the reasons you might consider it, and also why it may not make sense for you. The first thing to be aware of with regard to the Foundation is that we have a number of open source projects that have been assigned to us (currently 7, and growing). These projects are “collected” in what we refer to as Galleries. Just as a museum has collections of art grouped within a theme, so too does the Foundation. The Galleries are “sponsored” by companies that provide the foundation funding to invest in building out the collection within a specific gallery.<br />&#160;</p> <p>Here are three ways you might consider participating with the Foundation:<br /><span id="1285006737086S" style="display: none;">&#160;</span><span id="1285006738097S" style="display: none;">&#160;</span>1. Contribute to one or more projects<br /><span id="1285006741361S" style="display: none;">&#160;</span><span id="1285006742019S" style="display: none;">&#160;</span>2. Assign a project to a gallery<br /><span id="1285006746016S" style="display: none;">&#160;</span><span id="1285006746621S" style="display: none;">&#160;</span>3. Sponsor a gallery (a collection of open source projects tied to a particular technology or industry theme)<br />&#160;</p> <p>Here’s a quick synopsis on the how(s) and why(s):<br />&#160;</p> <p><strong>Contributing to a project</strong><br />We currently have 2 Galleries: the <a target="_blank" href="/galleries/aspnet">ASP.NET </a>Open Source Gallery and the <a target="_blank" href="/galleries/dlsi">Systems Infrastructure and Integration Gallery </a>(SIIG). As you look at the galleries and projects we currently support, you may find that we have a project that is addressing a technology challenge that is of importance to you. As you know, projects are only as strong as their community. Our current project leaders welcome new contributors to their projects. Each project has the flexibility to create their own web site, determine the license that applies to the project, and which forge the code will be hosted on. Simply navigate to the home page of project of interest, and contact the project leader. We have tried to minimize the bureaucracy, and allow the project leaders to establish the project management style that fits their project. You will need to sign a <a target="_blank" href="/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=1TNVRjyVZJQ%3d&amp;tabid=93">contribution agreement</a>, but all of your interaction to get started can happen directly with the project leader.&#160; Of course, if you have any questions, please feel free to contact us directly.<br />&#160;</p> <p><strong>Assigning a project to the Foundation<br /></strong>The first question you should ask yourself is, do I have a project that fits with the theme of the existing galleries.&#160; Equally important is why would you assign a project to the Foundation? We understand that choosing to join the Foundation will be a big decision for open source communities and the projects that they represent. All projects that join the Foundation will benefit from the shared resources available to the projects. The Foundation is building a collection of services and best practices from all of the participating projects and providing administrative and infrastructure support to projects and their communities.<br />&#160;</p> <p>A recent project, MVC Contrib, was assigned to the Foundation so that one company did not have to take on the entire burden of maintaining the project, and by assigning the IP to the Foundation other contributors were more willing to pitch in. Eric Hexter, the project lead provides a full accounting of why they chose to assign the project in a recent <a target="_blank" href="/Blogs/tabid/87/EntryId/14/An-interview-with-Eric-Hexter-MVC-Contrib-Project-Leader.aspx">podcast</a>.&#160;</p> <p><br />Project acceptance and operation guidelines are provided to step you through the simple process to gain acceptance into a gallery, assign your project, and expand your contributor base. Your first step would be to contact our <a href="javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(115,116,101,112,104,101,110,46,119,97,108,108,105,64,99,111,100,101,112,108,101,120,46,111,114,103)+'?')">technical director</a>, who will introduce you to the gallery manager.&#160; If your project is not related to our existing galleries, please contact us, as there may still be ways of accommodating the project.<br />&#160;</p> <p><strong>Sponsoring a Gallery</strong><br />As you are probably aware, our founding sponsor, Microsoft had an interest in encouraging open source projects. They put forward our initial funding, and we granted them the right to “sponsor” several galleries. Thus far, they have launched 2: ASP.NET (a technology gallery) and the Systems Infrastructure and Integration gallery (an interoperability gallery).&#160; The Foundation allows a company to sponsor a gallery to create community/collaboratively developed open source software projects. The Foundation provides the IP management process to demonstrate and maintain a clear provenance of the software, provides an arm’s-length liability firewall between the project and the core business, and encourages a community to form by not tightly holding the software property ownership.</p> <p><br />Our investment in the non-profit infrastructure, IP Process management, and project services offers a turn-key approach to any vendor wishing to build out a gallery of projects centered on a theme of benefit to the sponsor. The strategic oversight of the gallery is the responsibility of the sponsor-appointed gallery manager, and the Foundation manages the administrative and logistical affairs. Because we are license, technology, and forge agnostic, we offer a flexible way for companies to nurture a set of open source projects and communities without forming their own foundation. We like to call it our “Foundation in a Box”.<br />&#160;</p> <p>If you are interested in sponsoring a Gallery, we are happy to have that discussion. Simply contact our <a href="javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(112,97,117,108,97,46,104,117,110,116,101,114,64,99,111,100,101,112,108,101,120,46,111,114,103)+'?')">executive director</a>.<br /><br />&#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p>
