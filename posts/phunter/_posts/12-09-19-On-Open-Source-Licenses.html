<p>As a sidebar to Stephen Walli&rsquo;s recent post regarding &ldquo;<a target="blank" href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2f%2fBlogs%2fEntryId%2f65%2fOpen-Source-Software-Hygiene-and-STDs&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=431">software hygiene</a>&rdquo; and licensing, I wanted to follow up with a brief post on our stand with regard to specific licenses (I'll leave the more colorful analogies to Stephen).</p>
<p>From the early days of our formation, the Outercurve Foundation has taken an agnostic stance on the matter of licensing, within reason. We expect an inbound project to have a license, and we require projects to be licensed using any <a target="blank" href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fopensource.org%2flicenses%2fcategory&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=431">Open Source Initiative approved license</a>. </p>
<p> Early feedback included skeptics, some stating that &ldquo;until we had a GPL3&rdquo; licensed project in our portfolio, they would remain wary of us.&nbsp; I always wondered why the <a target="blank" href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2feclipse.org%2f&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=431">Eclipse Foundation </a>and <a target="blank" href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fwww.apache.org%2f&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=431">Apache Software Foundation</a> weren&rsquo;t held to the same standard, but, I am not naive, and realize that this comment is really a mask for their concerns about our founder, <a target="blank" href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fwww.microsoft.com%2fen-us%2fdefault.aspx&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=431">Microsoft</a>. </p>
<p>
The reason we chose to be license agnostic was to be flexible, and provide developers a destination that reduced the roadblocks to their participation in the open source development model. If the <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fopensource.org%2f&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429">Open Source Initiative</a> was comfortable that over 60 open source licenses &ldquo;conform to existing community norms and expectations&rdquo;, then we would respect their public review process.</p>
<p>Our process for accepting a project is based on our published <a target="blank" href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=123&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=431">Project Acceptance Process</a> and requires a project team to submit a <a target="blank" href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=123&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=431">Project Application form</a>, where they list the project license. As stated in our process, we simply ask &ldquo;What OSI approved license(s) will the project use for outbound license&rdquo;. That is where our scrutiny of the license choice ends.</p>
<p> There are times when project founders have asked for advice on choosing a license. While we do not provide legal advice, we will help the founder understand the types of licenses that are recognized by the OSI, and encourage the developer to flesh out their goals and intentions for the project. We don&rsquo;t have a dog in this hunt, our primary goal is to help the developers create a strong and vibrant project.</p>
<p>As we have grown, our portfolio now represents 25 projects, 285 contributing developers (of which 61% are not employed by Microsoft), and have the following breakdown regarding licenses:</p>

<p>Apache clearly stands out as the license of choice for more than half the projects, as for GPL3, we simply have not had any come our way, nor is that a benchmark we measure ourselves against.</p>
<p>I am a pragmatic person; I realize that as long as a significant source of our funds comes from Microsoft, there will be skeptics. That said, I like to be judged on actions and metrics rather than words. We have created a destination for a new wave of developers that want to embrace the open source model. That is what matters to me. I&rsquo;ll let someone else worry about the conspiracy theorists.</p>
