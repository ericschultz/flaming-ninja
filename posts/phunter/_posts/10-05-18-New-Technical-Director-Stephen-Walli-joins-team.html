<p>I am pleased to welcome Stephen Walli to the CodePlex team.&#160;&#160; If you are an open source veteran, you have likely met him. &#160;&#160; Stephen and I met at OSBC this year, and he already had a very good understanding of our mission and some constructive suggestions for us. &#160; &#160; &#160;</p> <p>Stephen will take an active role with the gallery managers to ensure that we are helping them achieve their goals.&#160;&#160; In addition, Stephen will engage with the project leaders to determine what programs or services they need from us to sustain their projects throughout their lifecycle.&#160;&#160; It is also time to start capturing and sharing best practices, we will have more to say about that in upcoming weeks.</p> <p>I&#160;am sure Stephen will welcome your input, in the mean time, Welcome Stephen!</p>
