<p>I spent a day at Rackspace’s <a href="http://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack </a>design summit last week in San Antonio. It was impressive to see the quality and depth of developer participation in an initiative that is not even a year old. Nearly 300 attendees gave up a good portion of the week to fly to San Antonio - at their expense - to advance the OpenStack platform.<br />
<br />
The event was broken out into technical and business tracks; and for obvious reasons, I attended the <a href="http://www.openstack.org/blog/2010/11/openstack-design-summit-business-track/">business track.</a><br />
<br />
One might have a bit of a sense of déjà vu listening to conversations regarding some of the go to market challenges, in particular, the pricing model. I sold outsourcing services and worked for several ASPs in the last decade, and it seems as if folks are still struggling with pricing. Rackspace clearly has a framework that addresses the base infrastructure (in fact, Outercurve runs our IT on Rackspace,) but the next level up the value chain is still a challenge for solution providers and resellers to package and sell.<br />
<br />
In my mind, this will continue to be the crux of the matter. If you think back to the late 90s when Citrix was working closely with a lot of software vendors and promoting ASPs…. Pricing out the application services proved to be challenging, and the models were as complex as they were varied. Then Salesforce.com broke through with simple pricing, its business took off, and more players followed suit. The reason Salesforce and others could employ such a simple model is that they weren’t faced with the challenges of legacy customers with complex licensing and pricing contracts. They didn’t have to preserve a high margin revenue stream that was in direct conflict with a SaaS model.<br />
<br />
If a solution provider cannot come up with a compelling and well articulated pricing strategy, IT departments will just build out their own private clouds. Not to rain on anyone’s cloud strategy, but a corporate-deployed, internal private cloud is nothing new, folks. The tools have just improved.<br />
<br />
Rackspace was smart to embrace open source and engage its resellers and tool providers to build out a framework that can deliver a cost effective, easy to deploy cloud solution. As the company simplifies the pricing and packaging of consumption-based infrastructure, it may increase the likelihood that solution providers will deliver a pricing model and offerings to the end customer that can be effectively evaluated and deployed.</p>
