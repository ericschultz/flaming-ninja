Nearly half of all open source projects <a href="http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2013/08/6-things-to-know-about-successful-open-source-software" target="_blank">end in failure</a> &ndash; either after the initiation stage or the first release. The projects that do succeed share common attributes that can be boiled down to effective project lifecycle management.<br />
<br />
University of Massachusetts professors Charles Schweik and Robert English examined over 174,000 open source projects for a recent book,&ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Internet-Success-Open-Source-Software-Commons/dp/0262017253/" target="_self">Internet Success: A Study of Open-Source Software Commons</a>.&rdquo; In summation, 145,475 projects were assessed and only 17 percent were deemed successful; 46 percent were abandoned before any code was written (the initiation stage); 37 percent failed soon after the first release.<br />
<br />
Projects that do succeed have a clearly defined vision, solve a problem, articulated goals, are supported by excellent project communications, and feature modular software architecture, a <a href="http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2013/08/6-things-to-know-about-successful-open-source-software" target="_blank">PBS article </a>summarizing the book said. Effective project lifecycle management creates the conditions where those characteristics are present.<br />
<br />
There is no shortage of guidance about building open source software (OSS) communities, but very little public discussion about the broader set of challenges a project leader needs to address as their project moves through its lifecycle.<br />
<br />
I recently spoke about this topic, and was encouraged that there are people who want to share best practices and lessons learned beyond the core work of actual coding. Later, sitting in several sessions at another conference, I was finding that we were back on the community-building topic, and frankly surprised, given the number of business people in the audience.<br />
<p>I view the project lifecycle as a virtuous one, where a project may cycle through these steps many times in its life. Here at the Outercurve Foundation, we have had projects come to us at various stages in the cycle, and find that the needs of the project team vary depending on where they are in the evolution of the project. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<img alt="" width="565" height="325" src="/img/old/lif%201.jpg" /></p>
Every project starts with an idea, a concept that is usually formed by one founder or a very small team of developers that have a passion to solve a specific problem, or an innovative idea that they want to test.<br />
<br />
The concept takes shape as the developers begin to develop code, but they are very far from a &ldquo;finished product.&rdquo; In order for the idea to blossom, the project concept and code must be shared, allowing the developer to engage in a feedback loop with one or more colleagues that may be able to help with the code, or provide input on the direction of the project.<br />
<br />
This launch phase spans the spectrum with regard to how vocal the project founder wants to be regarding the project. It may be months or years before he/she really wants to get broad exposure, and conversely there are some projects that will never flourish without input from a broader audience.<br />
<br />
As the code takes shape, the best way to accelerate development is to build a small community of good contributors that are willing to identify gaps and help fill them. Each new user is a potential contributing developer. Some of these developers will rise to the level of committers, a much-needed responsibility that helps lighten the load of the project leader.<br />
<p>You will know when the project has gained a head of steam when your message boards and forums light up with people looking for support and requesting features. In the early stages it may be other developers (and future coders), but as adoption increases you will cross over to people that are simply &ldquo;end users&rdquo; wanting to use the software, and who may not have the skills to contribute a single bug fix or patch. </p>
Supporting these often demanding users can be a huge burden for developers that want to focus on coding, but this can often be the inflection point for a commercial business opportunity.<br />
<p> A typical OSS project will often have a very simple yet effective functional structure. A project leader, often the founder, builds up a team of contributors and, over time, builds up a core set of committers that he/she leverages to vet code and spread the work across that subset of the community.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>The project founder will find unique challenges across the lifecycle, and with each circuit of the cycle, the challenges grow in scale and dimension.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that a typical OSS project team often has this functional structure:</p>

<p>How do you address these challenges? If you are working for a typical commercial software company (open source or not), you are likely used to a set of resources that can address a much broader set of functions for the development team.</p>

<p>The first thing to realize is that you don&rsquo;t have to do all this work yourself. If you start a project with your eyes wide open, you can anticipate your needs, and recruit support beyond developers working on just the software.
Decisions will need to be made, and most likely, you will be pulling out your credit card all through the project phases to acquire everything from domains to code signing certificates.</p>
<br />
Here are some of the decisions and tools you will have to be prepared to address:<br />
<br />
Concept<br />
&bull; Development environment<br />
&bull; Forge<br />
&bull; Choose the open source software license (www.opensource.org)<br />
&bull; Contribution mechanism<br />
&bull; Code certifications<br />
&bull; Co-conspirator and/or mentor<br />
<br />
Launch<br />
&bull; Name (please do a search!)<br />
o http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/index.jsp<br />
&bull; Domain<br />
&bull; Website<br />
&bull; Branding &ndash; what attributes do you want to convey about your project: Is it fun? Innovative? Serious? Altruistic?<br />
&bull; Social media &ldquo;plan&rdquo;<br />
&bull; App Stores &ndash; apply early if applicable<br />
<br />
Build Community<br />
&bull; Project awareness (see social media)<br />
&bull; Engage developers (proactively)<br />
&bull; Cultivate committers, contributors, testers<br />
&bull; Document the project management philosophy and social contract<br />
&bull; IP management and oversight<br />
&bull; Utilize forums, wiki, mailing list<br />
&bull; Host meet-ups and attend conferences<br />
&bull; Celebrate success and say thank you!<br />
<br />
Sustain Support<br />
&bull; Set expectations (not everyone understands your OSS ethos)<br />
&bull; Prepare documentation (you may need to pay someone, or create bounties)<br />
&bull; Respond to bug fixes and patches even if you don&rsquo;t intend to implement them<br />
&bull; Charge if necessary (a business opportunity).<br />
<br />
Some projects by their nature end up with a large number of end users that want support and need it urgently enough to pay for it. Many OSS project developers have considered how they might create a business doing what they love, and this too becomes part of the consideration.<br />
<br />
Adoption<br />
&bull; Use will enhance the project<br />
&bull; Create a feedback loop for non-developer end users.<br />
&bull; Can you sustain more iteration?<br />
&bull; Develop a succession plan for committer leadership.<br />
<br />
We believe that projects that follow these practices are more likely to succeed. Taking the time to identify where you are in a project&rsquo;s lifecycle and following the appropriate steps, creates a framework for success. The challenges that project leaders face vary throughout the lifecycle; your ability to address them shouldn&rsquo;t.
