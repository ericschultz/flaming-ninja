<p>I attended a meeting of the Harmony project in Boston today. Project Harmony is intended to assist organizations which use contribution agreements by providing standardized variable templates with clear and concise explanations; to come to a common understanding on these; and to recognize the relative maturity of FOSS by dealing with its internationalism. The legal concepts associated with contributions and assignments are fraught with debate. Rather than attempt to dictate “an answer”, the founding principal of the project is to make it easier for developers to contribute.<br /><br />My initial reaction – “no small task”. Imagine a room full of attorneys and open source veterans, add in additional participants via video and phone, and the vision of herding cats is evoked. Amanda Brock, General Counsel of Canonical did a fine job of moving the discussion along.<br /><br />This was the third meeting of the group (my first), and there is still a lot of work to be done before we will see deliverables. I found the conversation spirited, polite, and rich with legal nuance. Project Harmony will harvest the knowledge of an impressive panel of legal minds, without having to worry about billable hours.   Call it the open source legal advice model (OSLAM).<br /><br />A BOF session is being held tonight at Linuxcon, will post reaction here later. If you have any interest in this topic, I would encourage you to join the project (email Amanda.brock@canonical.com).</p>
