<p>I am happy to report a new project that has joined the <a href="/LinkClick.aspx?link=115&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=431">Research Accelerators Gallery</a>, the Data Curation for Excel (<a href="/LinkClick.aspx?link=166&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=431">DataUp</a>) project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>DataUp allows scientific data curation by enabling researchers to check and make Excel data files CSV compatible; apply metadata; generate citations, and post data files to DataONE repositories. DataUp meets the needs of scientists and researchers actively working with data used in environmental science. The project&rsquo;s contributors also are collecting suggestions and requirements from libraries, data centers, data managers, and other data professionals who use or house scientific data, including libraries and publishers.</p>
<p>
The DataUp project is run through the <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3">University of California Curation Center (UC3)</a> at the California Digital Library, a division of the University of California Office of the President. UC3 members working on DataUp include Carly Strasser, Trisha Cruse, John Kunze, and  Stephen Abrams.</p>
<p>Welcome to Outercurve, and may your project grow and flourish. </p>
