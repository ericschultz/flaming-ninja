<p>I am sitting here in Portland Maine at the Monktoberfest, a nicely scaled event with a great balance of techies and not. &nbsp; It seems every presentation is touching or diving into the topic of social media. &nbsp;This has caused me to start some serious multi-tasking, because I have the second to last speaking slot of the conference, and guess what, my topic includes the words "social media". &nbsp; Need to enhance my slides.</p>
<p>The great thing is this crowd is doing a great job of pointing out some great ideas and "lessons" about how to engage in this frustrating, fun, and potentially project altering endeavor.</p>
<p>I'll start with my premise that YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PROJECT BRAND. &nbsp; &nbsp;Regardless of your role or the type of project you are engaged in. &nbsp;That said, all brands are not alike. &nbsp; A project that creates a social media destination for beer drinkers will tolerate a vastly different tone than a project that addresses secure financial transactions for large banks. &nbsp; A tool that helps your mother open the garage door with her phone has an end user audience that is simply not interested in which scripting language you think sucks today.</p>
<p>Stop and think about what you are trying to achieve with your project. &nbsp;Scratching an itch? &nbsp;Extending your company's platform? &nbsp; Trying to start a business? &nbsp;If you are going to tweet about your project, you must consider this. &nbsp; You may also want to think about your own personal brand and if it will or should overlap with the project brand.</p>
