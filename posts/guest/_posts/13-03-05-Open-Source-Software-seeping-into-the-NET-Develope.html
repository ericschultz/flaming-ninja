<p><strong>Question: </strong>Tell us about your company and your relationship with the .NET community.</p>
<p><strong>Patrick Hynds: </strong>I have been part of the .NET community since I first learned about the technology before it was even released. We provide development and security consulting in addition to building commercial software products. While we do work with a wide range of technologies, I personally consider .NET my primary platform and when I speak at user groups and Code Camps it is always either on security or .NET.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Why have .NET developers been slow to adopt open source? Many of them operate in the mixed Windows/Linux world, what was the issue?</p>
<p><strong>PH: </strong>The open source movement is not incompatible with the Microsoft development world, but the relationship between the two had been hostile in that both view the world differently at the macro level.&nbsp; For example, commercial software developers represent a big constituency among the .NET Framework community and based on my experience these shops are very cautious about incorporating open source libraries because the licensing (e.g. the GNU General Public License) can influence how their entire solution is licensed and sold. Uncertainty and a lack of understanding of the legal implications have fed this hesitancy.</p>
<p>This uncertainty sets the stage for avoidance of open source components by a large part of the .NET developer population. In fact I had seen developers fired because they included a component into a project without getting clearance to ensure the license of that component did not impinge on the licensing of the project as a whole. </p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>But the GPL license isn&rsquo;t the only option for FOSS projects, is there more comfort with less restrictive licenses, such as BSD and Apache? </p>
<p><strong>PH:&nbsp;</strong> Part of the issue is educating the legal community that has been very focused on protecting their client&rsquo;s sales model and IP. With big open source projects becoming mainstream on Windows, more and more developers have realized that there are open source licenses that can work with their business model. In many cases this has just been a learning curve that business people and their attorneys needed to work through.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>There was a lot of FUD about security early on, is that still a concern?</p>
<p><strong>PH: </strong>Many windows developers had been told that because anyone can contribute that the code in open source projects can contain back doors while the open source crowd holds the position that more eyes on the code brings greater transparency and therefore better security.&nbsp;The truth is that in most cases open source components are safe provided the keeper of the final code is vigilant.&nbsp;The safest way to proceed is to pay attention to who controls the code in the project. In reality anyone can submit code to an open source project, but that does not mean that that code is accepted and incorporated into the final libraries. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>What areas are you seeing more interest in by .NET developers?</p>
<p><strong>PH: </strong>A light at the end of this tunnel appears to be <a href="https://nuget.org/">NuGet</a>.&nbsp;NuGet, an open source package management system was built by Microsoft (assigned to the <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/Galleries/ASPNETOpenSourceGallery/NuGet">Outercurve Foundation</a>), and ultimately integrated into Visual Studio.&nbsp;Since its introduction I have seen a big jump in the willingness of Microsoft development shops to try open source libraries and include them in their projects.&nbsp;Visual Studio development is a very productive, comfortable, and comprehensive environment.&nbsp;It has historically required developers to do little to nothing to knock out a site or system and spares the developer from tracking down the correct component versions of their environment which is a regular experience for java developers.&nbsp;NuGet helps developers have their cake and eat it too in regards to getting packages and libraries for just about everything without the strain typically associated with composing a solution from many packages and their dependencies.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I think this one factor will see a lot more open source finding its way into Microsoft-based development, and while some may still steer clear of the GPL, there are dozens of FOSS licenses that are compatible with Windows developers and their customers.</p>
