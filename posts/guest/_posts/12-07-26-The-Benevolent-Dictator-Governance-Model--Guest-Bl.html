<p>In a previous post we discussed how a successful <a href="/Blogs/EntryId/55/Guest-post-Open-Development-by-Ross-Gardler">open source project needs strong leadership</a>. There are as many potential models of leadership as there are people in a project, so how do you define the right model for your project?</p>
<p>This post is the first of two that examine common governance models. These two approaches appear to be diametrically opposed. The first is the Benevolent Dictator model, where a single individual has absolute authority. The second is the meritocratic model, where valuable contributions are rewarded with collective leadership authority. Once you understand both of these "extremes" you'll see that, in practice, they are not as dissimilar as they first seem. </p>
<p><a name="OrgXref.sec-1-1"></a>A benevolent dictator is an individual who has complete control over the decision making process in an open source project. Linus Torvalds is perhaps the most well known "benevolent dictator." Being a benevolent dictator is not an easy job. It requires diplomacy and community building skills, in-depth technical knowledge of all aspects of the project, and exceptional levels of commitment and dedication. However, as the Linux Kernel project illustrates, it can be very effective.</p>
<h2>Introduction to Benevolent Dictatorship</h2>
<p>The benevolent dictator model relies heavily on the fact that an open source licence allows anyone to take the code and spin up their own project. This means that although the leader has full control over their project they must still work to ensure that community needs are met. Failure to do so will result in a splintering of the community as objectors set up their own projects based on the same code. </p>
<p>A benevolent dictator who wishes to create a vibrant community project must therefore seek to ensure each decision is both understood and supported by as many community members as possible. Consequently, diplomacy, mediation and clarity are just three of the softer skills that a BD needs. </p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="sec-1-1-2"></a><a name="OrgXref.sec-1-1-2"></a> Decision Making </h2>
<p>Although Benevolent Dictators (BDs) are usually highly skilled from a technical perspective they are unlikely to be the best person to make every technical decision. A good BD recognises this and seeks to enable the community to collectively make decisions under the guidance of the most skilled members. When the community is unable to reach consensus the BD will intervene by making what they believe to be the most appropriate decision. In this way a BD seeks to prevent the project from becoming paralysed by indecision. </p>
<p>It is therefore the BD's job to resolve disputes within the community and to ensure that the project is able to progress in a coordinated way. In turn, it is the community's job to guide the decisions of the BD through active engagement and contribution. Consequently the Benevolent Dictator model can scale because, in the majority of cases, the BD is not needed to allow the community to progress. </p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="sec-1-1-3"></a><a name="OrgXref.sec-1-1-3"></a> Roles, responsibilities and delegation </h2>
<p>Typically, the benevolent dictator, or project lead, is self-appointed. They will usually be the originator of the project or their appointed successor. In many ways, the role of the benevolent dictator is less about dictatorship and more about diplomacy. The key is to ensure that, as the project expands, the right people (those who concur with the BD's vision) are recognised as community leaders. </p>
<p>The BD is, usually, the one who commits all changes to the code base. Other contributors provide <a href="http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/softwarepatch.xml">patches</a> which are reviewed by the BD. This submission and review process is carried out in public to enable community review and feedback. In this way all code goes through a quality control process and all community members are given the opportunity to influence implementation details. However, this process makes the BD a bottleneck in contributions and thus can limit the scalability of the model. </p>
<p>To address this potential scalability problem a BD will often identify community members to act as their representatives in well defined areas of the project. These representatives will be given limited write access to sections of the code and will be able to review and commit patches on behalf of the BD. In general these people will have demonstrated their ability to understand the quality assurance processes adopted by the project as well as its broader strategic vision. </p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="sec-1-1-4"></a><a name="OrgXref.sec-1-1-4"></a> Advantages and disadvantages </h2>
<p>The benevolent dictator governance structure is not an easy one to manage and requires a very special person in the role of the project lead. However, its this organisational simplicity can make it work extremely well. </p>
<p>One downside is that it requires the community to fully trust a single individual, both today and in an undefined future. For many people this dependence on a central figure puts the project at risk since individual circumstances change, as do employers objectives. One way to avoid this is to ensure the project lead is employed by a neutral organisation, for example Linus Torvalds, BD of the Linux kernel, is employed by the <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/about">Linux Foundation</a>. </p>
<p>A further concern is that the loss of the BD will cause the project to stall or even fail. A clear succession plan with pre-identified successors can help mitigate this risk. </p>

<h2 class="western">Conclusion</h2>
<h4 class="western"> </h4>
<p>A community oriented project can be led by a single individual, but that individual needs to be a very special person with an unusual combination of technical, leadership and social skills. They need to gain and retain the trust of the community and, as the project grows, they need to find ways to scale the model. </p>
<p>Whilst the Benevolent Dictator model can be very effective the limitation of the model, in its pure form, often result in a structure where absolute control is rarely enforced. In the next post we'll outline an alternative governance model, called the meritocratic model, which avoids the limitations of the BD model but brings a different set of disadvantages. By understanding both these models you will be well equipped to ensure your own open source project has <a href="/Blogs/EntryId/55/Guest-post-Open-Development-by-Ross-Gardler">the strong leadership it needs</a> to succeed. </p>
