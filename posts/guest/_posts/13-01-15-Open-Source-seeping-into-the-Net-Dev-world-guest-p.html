<p>&nbsp;<img alt="" src="/img/old/PatrickHynds.png" />The Open Source movement is not incompatible with the Microsoft development world, but the relationship between the two is often hostile in that both view the world differently at the macro level.&nbsp; For example, Commercial software developers represent a big constituency among the .Net Framework community and based on my experience these shops are very cautious about incorporating open source libraries because their licensing can influence how their entire solution is licensed without always realizing what has happened.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Open Source zealots, like Richard Stallman specifically, are openly hostile to the idea of making money selling software.&nbsp; Stallman has modified the GNU license over time making it impossible to leverage anything covered by later versions of the license in any commercial solution that is meant to be sold.&nbsp; This sets the stage for avoidance of Open Source components by a large part of the .Net developer population.&nbsp; In fact I have seen developers fired because they included a component into a project without getting clearance to ensure the license of that component did not impinge on the licensing of the project as a whole. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another aspect that is in dispute is the security component.&nbsp; Many windows developers have been told that because anyone can contribute that the code in open source projects can contain back doors while the open source crowd holds the position that more eyes on the code brings greater transparency and therefore better security.&nbsp; The truth is that in most cases open source components are safe provided the keeper of the final code is not trying to use it to get back doors into systems.&nbsp; The safest way to proceed is to pay attention to who controls the code in the project.&nbsp; In reality anyone can submit code to an open source project, but that does not mean that that code is accepted and incorporated into the final libraries. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The light at the end of this tunnel appears to be <a re_target="_blank" href="/LinkClick.aspx?link=114&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429" target="_blank">NuGet</a>.&nbsp; NuGet is an open source package management system that was built by Microsoft, assigned to the Outercurve Foundation, and ultimately integrated into Visual Studio.&nbsp; Since its introduction I have seen a big jump in the willingness of Microsoft development shops to try open source libraries and including them into their projects.&nbsp; Visual Studio development is a very productive and comfortable, comprehensive environment.&nbsp; It has historically required developers to do little to nothing to knock out a site or system and spares the developer from tracking down the correct component versions of their environment which is a regular experience for java developers.&nbsp; NuGet helps developers have their cake and eat it too in regards to getting packages and libraries for just about everything without the strain typically associated with composing a solution from many packages.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I think this one factor will see a lot more open source finding its way into Microsoft based development, GNU licensing notwithstanding.</p>
