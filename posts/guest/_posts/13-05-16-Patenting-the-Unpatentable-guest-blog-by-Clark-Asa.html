Many in the free and open source software (FOSS) world have long held the view that patents threaten their very way of life. Indeed, <a re_target="_blank" target="_blank" href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2f%2fBlogs%2fEntryId%2f85%2fFOSS-and-Patents-Peer-Collaboration-as-a-Key-to-Countering-Patent-Risk-guest-blog-by-Clark-Asay&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429">I recently wrote</a> that patents pose the biggest intellectual property risks that FOSS communities face and reviewed some of the strategies that FOSS communities use to try to protect themselves from these risks. </p>
<p>One strategy that has received increased attention more recently is that FOSS communities should more aggressively obtain patents for defensive purposes. According to this line of thought, the patent system isn&rsquo;t going away any time soon, and unless FOSS communities arm themselves with patents, patent-wielding competitors will give them no quarter. The <a re_target="_blank" target="_blank" href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fwww.openinventionnetwork.com%2f&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429">Open Invention Network</a> and its defense of Linux are largely based on this idea. Another <a re_target="_blank" target="_blank" href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fpapers.ssrn.com%2fsol3%2fpapers.cfm%3fabstract_id%3d2040945&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429">recent proposal</a> advocating adoption of a &ldquo;Defensive Patent License&rdquo; has urged open innovation communities to more diligently obtain patents for defensive purposes. Some companies heavily involved in FOSS seem to be following this tactic. Google&rsquo;s acquisition of Motorola Mobility, for instance, was l<a re_target="_blank" target="_blank" href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fwww.patentlyo.com%2fpatent%2f2011%2f08%2fgoogles-purchase-of-motorola-mobility.html&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429">argely viewed</a> as a quick means by which to obtain significant numbers of patents to help protect the Android ecosystem. Red Hat has also begun to build up a <a re_target="_blank" target="_blank" href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fwww.redhat.com%2fabout%2fnews%2farchive%2f2011%2f3%2fred-hat-patent-portfolio-gains-independent-recognition-for-its-strength&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429">significant defensive patent portfolio</a>.</p>
<p> But what are the limits of a strategy that relies on FOSS communities patenting their technologies? Others have chronicled the <a re_target="_blank" target="_blank" href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fpapers.ssrn.com%2fsol3%2fpapers.cfm%3fabstract_id%3d2040945&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429">perceived reasons</a> for why FOSS communities don&rsquo;t obtain patents: a general cultural disdain for the patent system; dispersed communities without the means to pursue and enforce costly patents; and a fear that once created, patents can end up in the wrong hands and wreak havoc. </p>
<p>While all of these reasons certainly have some merit, it may also be true that FOSS development by its very nature makes patenting more difficult. Consequently, while advocating increased patenting may make some sense, the strategy as a whole has its limits. </p>
For instance, one of the primary advantages of FOSS development is its decentralized nature. While FOSS communities often have hierarchies and power players, the general development model allows diverse contributors to collectively and efficiently create software. As such, in many cases it may be difficult to determine who the inventor of any given inventive concept actually is. And patents require inventors to be specified. In some cases, especially in projects where one contributor is the primary contributor to the project, this may not be an issue. But in highly collaborative projects, where each contributor is adding some incremental piece to a larger inventive concept, it almost certainly is.<br />
<p> </p>
<p>Could FOSS communities solve this puzzle by collectively pursuing patents on their projects? &ldquo;Joint inventorship&rdquo; is a well-established doctrine in patent law that allows multiple inventors to file for and obtain patents. Realistically, though, this isn&rsquo;t a likely solution. For starters, because of the collaborative, incremental nature of FOSS development, in many cases it would be difficult to determine who from any given community qualifies as a joint inventor. Only those that contribute significant material to the inventive concept embodied in the patent&rsquo;s claims are considered joint inventors; those that merely implement the invention or that contribute only &ldquo;prior art&rdquo; material are not. </p>
But more fundamentally, the type of coordination and consensus necessary for FOSS projects to jointly pursue, maintain, and enforce patents seems unlikely. For instance, enforcing jointly owned patents in a court of law requires the unanimous consent of all joint owners. Each joint owner also has the right to assign their equal, undivided right in the patent to anyone else they wish, regardless of any objections that other joint inventors may raise. Effectively resolving these and similar issues would require FOSS communities to increasingly take on the attributes of a traditional firm. But one of the points of FOSS development is to transcend the limitations that firms impose. FOSS communities may excel at collaborating to create technology, but this model of decentralized collaboration is precisely what would make collectively pursuing, maintaining, and enforcing patents difficult if not impossible in many cases.<br />
<p> </p>
<p>Contributors to FOSS projects could ignore these possible inventorship issues and simply pursue patents on larger inventive concepts that the community collectively creates. And some almost certainly have done exactly that. But, aside from the informal discomfort of other participants to the perceived land grab by such contributors, formal patent law may also present some hurdles. For instance, would such a patent application qualify as &ldquo;non-obvious,&rdquo; a requirement under patent law, if others in the community have already contributed pieces that suggest the inventive concept? Would the patent application pass the &ldquo;novelty&rdquo; requirement under patent law if others within the community have already implemented a version of the inventive concept that includes all elements of the patent&rsquo;s claims? </p>
To answer my own questions, it shouldn&rsquo;t. But patents issue all the time despite being obvious and lacking novelty; <a re_target="_blank" target="_blank" href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fwww.zdnet.com%2fpatents-shouldnt-apply-to-the-obvious-7000003547%2f&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429">others have long complained</a> about the United States Patent and Trademark Office in this regard, especially in the <a re_target="_blank" target="_blank" href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fwww.gnu.org%2fphilosophy%2ftrivial-patent.html&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429">software world</a>. So contributors could probably get away with patenting the inventions of the collective community, at least as an initial matter. But competitors wishing to invalidate such patents would in many cases have a freely accessible store of prior art (i.e., the contributions of others in the FOSS community) to which they could point in seeking to invalidate the patents. <a re_target="_blank" target="_blank" href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fwww.fosspatents.com%2f2010%2f04%2fpatents-as-threat-to-free-and-open.html&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429">Others have suggested</a> that the availability of the source code makes FOSS communities more susceptible to patent infringement claims because the ability to inspect the source code makes it easier to detect and prove patent infringement. By the same token, the availability of the source code may also make FOSS patents easier to eventually invalidate, even if such patents do initially issue.<br />
<p>In a traditional firm, these issues are easily resolved. The firm files for and obtains patents covering the collective contributions of its employees and contractors. Modern patent law thus accommodates this mode of production rather well. But where inventive activity transcends a firm and embraces a larger community, modern patent law fails to be as embracing.</p>
Nor should we expect it to be. The traditional premise behind modern patent law is that centralization of rights is good and necessary to promote innovation. The idea behind FOSS is that decentralization is actually a better innovative model in many cases. Given this inherent conflict, trying to merge the two models of innovation becomes a messy business.<br />
<p> </p>
<p>So is FOSS doomed? The clear answer is no. While patent wars are escalating (see, for instance, the <a re_target="_blank" target="_blank" href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fonline.wsj.com%2farticle_email%2fSB10001424127887323687604578467263432599452-lMyQjAxMTAzMDAwNzEwNDcyWj.html&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429">worldwide smartphone patent mess</a>), the advantages of FOSS often still outweigh its disadvantages, including those associated with patent risks. Indeed, though FOSS communities may be increasingly subject to patent assertions from both patent trolls and commercial competitors alike, in most cases FOSS is probably still a good deal. It&rsquo;s initially free in many cases; a community is there to help resolve issues and take the technology in new directions; and access to the source code guarantees greater flexibility, among other advantages. True, FOSS may not be as good of a deal as it once was as patent disputes escalate. But it retains many of its advantages in spite of the current patent system.</p>
Furthermore, while the FOSS communities&rsquo; strategies for combatting patent risks may have significant limitations, they still provide some help. The ideal solution is to reform patent law to better accommodate alternative models of innovation such as the FOSS movement. But in the meantime, doing what&rsquo;s possible within the current patent system may make the most sense.<br />
<p> </p>
<p>In sum, while patenting FOSS may help in some cases, the nature of FOSS development itself may mean that patenting some collaboratively developed inventions is inherently more difficult, if not impossible, in many others. Consequently, strategies for mitigating patent risk that rely on FOSS communities patenting their technologies include inherent limitations. It&rsquo;s not entirely clear how best to reform patent law in order to better reconcile it with alternative models of innovation. But in the meantime, FOSS still presents certain advantages that, while dimmed by the prospect of patent suits, remain significant.</p>
