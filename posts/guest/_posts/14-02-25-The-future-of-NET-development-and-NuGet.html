title: "The future of .NET development and NuGet"

<p>It&rsquo;s been around for a while, that little thing called NuGet. We used to try and find third party code and assemblies using a web search engine, often compiling them ourselves and fighting with dependencies. For over two years now, we replaced that with NuGet. We can now search for packages and with the click of a button (or a command line keystroke) install the dependencies we need, update to the latest version of dependencies and so on. But have we gone far enough in the time NuGet has been around? Let&rsquo;s find out.</p>
<h2>We are consumers</h2>
<p>By now everyone is familiar with consuming NuGet packages through Visual Studio. Search, click install and we have added yet another dependency to our project. Some are creating NuGet packages and publishing them to NuGet.org so we can all use them. But who is componentizing and packaging their own modules, for use in their company?</p>
<p>Package and dependency management is not something new. Ecosystems other than .NET have been doing this for years. Linux has had packages for installing operating system components. Java has had Maven for quite a while, even Perl had CPAN.org when I first started server-side development. For .NET developers, these concepts are still young and we can see that in the way we are using NuGet.</p>
<p>As described earlier, we are all one-way users of NuGet. We are all consuming packages and that&rsquo;s fine. However if we look at other ecosystems, say Node.js, a lot more packages are being produced. Allow me to explain. When starting development on a Node.js application, we can <em>npm init</em> to generate a <em>package.json</em> file, comparable with the <em>.nuspec</em> files used to create NuGet packages. This <em>package.json</em> contains information about the current application as well as dependencies whenever these are installed.</p>
<h2>Every application is a package</h2>
<p>When every application built can in fact be a package, these applications can be published to a public repository or a private one. We can deploy these package artifacts from the repository to their target environments. </p>
<p>Other applications can depend on applications published on this repository. We can build a web front-end and back-end as separate applications and bring them together in a meta-application by adding them as dependencies. And if this meta-application is also a package, we can use that one as a dependency for even other applications or deploy this meta-application over a series of target machines. Imagine describing the software systems in your company by crafting a dependency tree&hellip;</p>
<h2>Project references must die</h2>
<p>When every Visual Studio project is a NuGet package, whether it&rsquo;s an application or a class library, why would we still need project references? If I would have received a dollar for every time I had to share a project over multiple solutions, fighting relative paths and so on, I would have been rich by now. Using NuGet, we can simply reference our dependencies as NuGet packages. No more shared sources, no more compilation errors because of awry paths. And the best part of it all: projects can easily depend on different versions of these shared dependencies.</p>
<h2>We can do all of this today</h2>
<p>The best part of all of this is we can do this today. NuGet does not have a <em>package.json</em> in which both the current application and its dependencies are described. We do have a <em>.nuspec</em> for the first, and <em>packages.config</em> for the latter. Private repositories can be created by running a copy of the <a href="http://www.github.com/nuget/nugetgallery">NuGet.org website</a> or using a service like <a href="http://www.myget.org">MyGet</a>. Deployments can be done using <a href="http://www.octopusdeploy.com">OctopusDeploy</a> or <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/delivery/deployment-manager">Deployment Manager</a>. Afraid packaging shared projects is not going to work? It will. Use <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-online-overview-vs">Visual Studio Online</a>, <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity">TeamCity</a> or <a href="http://www.myget.org/">MyGet</a> to build and publish these packages. Stop just consuming NuGet packages and re-think your development by also creating them. Looking at other ecosystems, this is what we&rsquo;re evolving to.</p>
