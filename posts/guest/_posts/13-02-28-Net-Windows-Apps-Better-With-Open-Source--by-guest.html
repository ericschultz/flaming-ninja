<p>I&rsquo;ve spent my entire 25+ year career on &ldquo;closed&rdquo; platforms. And I&rsquo;ve spent my entire career using and creating what is now called open source software. A surprising number of people seem to think these two things are in opposition, but they really aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>
Since 1991 I&rsquo;ve worked on the Microsoft platform with Windows NT and now Windows 8 with Microsoft .NET, and over all that time I&rsquo;ve relied on and contributed to &ldquo;freeware&rdquo;, &ldquo;shareware&rdquo;, and &ldquo;open source&rdquo; software. </p>
<p>There are many reasons people consume open source software, but chief among them is the desire to get software that is &ldquo;free as in beer&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s face it, when you are early in your career you may not have the money to buy professional products. And at any time in your career your employer may not be willing to pay for professional products. Fortunately in many cases there are very good open source products available that have no monetary cost.
</p>
<p>It is important to recognize that open source projects often provide solutions to problems that aren&rsquo;t addressed by commercial players, and they often provide innovations or experimental options that otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t exist. Sure, you can muddle through filling in the gaps between various commercial products, but in many cases some open source developer has already solved the problem and all you need to do is leverage their existing work.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve relied on such products throughout my career to learn new programming languages (using open source compilers), new technologies (open source TCP and uucp stack implementations), and so on. And I&rsquo;ve relied on such products to solve serious business problems such as reformatting thousands of lines of text using awk.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s world I use open source tools such as NuGet, ASP.NET MVC, and git daily. And of course I use and maintain my widely-used open source CSLA .NET development framework.</p>
<p>There are also many reasons people become contributors to open source projects. In my case it is because my career wouldn&rsquo;t be where it is without access to open source products over the years. For me being involved with open source is a way of saying thank you to those who&rsquo;ve gone before, and hopefully helping others build their careers going forward. Other people use open source as a way of sharing cool work that isn&rsquo;t yet commercially viable, or to build their careers by demonstrating amazing skill in a public venue. Still others use open source as a launch-pad for commercial products, or as a try-before-you-buy licensing scheme. And of course some people pursue open source for ideological &ldquo;free as in speech&rdquo; reasons.</p>
<p>There has been an explosion of open source projects on the Microsoft .NET platform over the past decade. This is bolstered by hosting sites such as <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fwww.codeplex.com%2f&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429" target="_blank">www.codeplex.com</a> and <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fwww.github.com%2f&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429" target="_blank">www.github.com</a>, and Microsoft&rsquo;s increasing use of open source as an important part of the .NET and Azure ecosystems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been an open source developer on the Microsoft platform since 1996. Obviously a lot has changed over the past 17 years, primarily around distribution and marketing. When I started the web was just becoming mainstream, but today most people expect to browse and download installers and source code at any time, from anywhere. Centralized open source hosting sites now exist to support open source developers, and Microsoft product teams use and advocate for open source projects. They even contribute heavily to some, such as jquery and node.js. Integrated distribution tools such as NuGet make it ever easier to find, use, and update open source tools and components in your projects.</p>
I&rsquo;m constantly amazed at the passion of the open source community on the Microsoft platform, and I&rsquo;m thrilled by Microsoft&rsquo;s increasing embrace of open source as time goes on. My deeply rooted hope is that developers are able to build better software, and further their careers by using and contributing to open source projects now and into the future.
