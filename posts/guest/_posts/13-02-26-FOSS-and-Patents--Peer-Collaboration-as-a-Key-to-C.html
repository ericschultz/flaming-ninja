<p>In an <a href="/Blogs/EntryId/80/The-Real-Risks-of-Using-FOSS-guest-post-by-Clark-Asay">earlier post</a> I suggested that third-party patents pose the most significant risk of using free and open source software (FOSS). The risk boils down to this: with limited exceptions, someone with a patent that reads on FOSS can prevent anyone else from using that FOSS, even if you or somebody else independently created the software. And under the current patent system, it&rsquo;s entirely possible to obtain a patent that reads on software that FOSS communities independently create. Consequently, FOSS communities and their users are vulnerable to third party patent claims, even absent any sort of wrongdoing or copying on their part. </p>
<br />
FOSS communities have fretted over this risk for years. This fretting is often accompanied with complaints about software patents themselves&mdash;software shouldn&rsquo;t be subject to patents at all; software patents are often granted on obvious &ldquo;innovations&rdquo; or methods that have been in use for years; and the patent system favors large corporations over smaller developers.<br />
<br />
So what&rsquo;s to be done? On the general question of software patentability, recent legislative and judicial activity hasn&rsquo;t done opponents of software patents any favors. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-964.pdf" target="_self">Bilski v. Kappos</a>, the US Supreme Court declined to hold that business methods, software, or any other categories of technology are unpatentable subject matter unless the US Congress says so. And it hasn&rsquo;t said so. In fact, Congress recently enacted the most far-reaching patent law reforms in nearly 60 years, the <a href="http://www.natlawreview.com/article/summary-america-invents-act" target="_blank">America Invents Act of 2011 </a>(AIA), but none of the AIA&rsquo;s reforms purported to exclude software as patentable subject matter. Nor is that outcome likely anytime soon. <br />
<br />
But the AIA did include some reforms that may serve FOSS communities well. For instance, the AIA includes <a href="http://www.aiarulemaking.com/rulemaking-topics/group-2/post-grant-review.php" target="_blank">enhanced procedures</a> for challenging and invalidating patents. These procedures include a new post-grant review system that allows any third party to introduce evidence to invalidate a patent within 9 months of the patent&rsquo;s issuance.  As part of such a review, the requesting party is not limited to introducing evidence of other issued patents or printed publications (as was the case in the predecessor system); almost any type of evidence is now permitted to invalidate the issued patent. <br />
<br />
FOSS communities in particular could play a significant role in using these enhanced procedures to weed out patents that never should have issued. Indeed, one of the more promising ways for FOSS communities to counteract the threat of software patents is, ironically, to do exactly what FOSS communities do best: quickly develop a lot of great code and release it to the public. Once released, this code becomes &ldquo;prior art&rdquo; that can 1) undermine future patent applications seeking patents that read on the released code, and 2) serve as a basis, under the post-grant review system, for invalidating a patent that may have issued despite the released FOSS having been published before the patentee came up with the same inventive concept.<br />
<br />
But there&rsquo;s a kick: it&rsquo;s generally not enough to just release code. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is swamped with patent applications, and so patent examiners usually don&rsquo;t have a lot of time to search the prior art to determine whether a patent application covers a new, novel, and non-obvious invention (these terms all have special meanings in patent law, but that&rsquo;s for another day). In fact, some studies suggest they spend as little as <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=281395" target="_blank">18 hours</a> total on each application, and that total includes all the back-and-forth between an applicant and the patent examiner over several years. Furthermore, bare released code isn&rsquo;t self-evident in terms of the inventive concept it implements. Overall, then, even if FOSS covering the invention is out there, it can be difficult for patent examiners to find. And even if they do, they may not comprehend the FOSS without documentation describing what the code does.<br />
<br />
So while releasing lots of great code as early as possible is a good start, it&rsquo;s not enough. The code needs to be released in an accessible, documented manner. Fortunately for FOSS communities, there are groups ready and willing to help. One such group is <a href="http://linuxdefenders.org/" target="_blank">Linux Defenders</a>. Their stated mission is to help FOSS communities help themselves by providing resources to create &ldquo;defensive publications&rdquo; and other means of invalidating frivolous patents and patent applications. The USPTO has also expressed a desire to improve the quality of software patents and work in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-01-03/pdf/2012-31594.pdf">collaboration with software communities</a> in order to do so. Some such collaboration has already occurred through <a target="_blank" href="http://peertopatent.org/">Peer-to-Patent</a>, a joint project between the USPTO and New York Law School aimed at allowing the public to review and provide input to certain patent applications. The AIA reforms, together with the help of such groups as Linux Defenders and a growing partnership with the USPTO, make now a particularly opportune time for FOSS communities to collaboratively counteract a threat that has long been a thorn in their collective side.  <br />
<br />
There are, of course, other ways that FOSS communities can seek to protect themselves from the threat of third-party patents. In some contexts these other means have merit, but they also have significant limitations. First, FOSS communities can seek their own patents, but there a number of reasons why this often doesn&rsquo;t happen. For starters, many in the FOSS world simply don&rsquo;t believe in software patents and so don&rsquo;t seek them out of principle. Second, prosecuting patents is costly, and the dispersed nature of FOSS communities and their limited resources means seeking patents in many cases is impractical. Furthermore, even if some FOSS projects obtained a patent or two, it&rsquo;s unclear how that would help. Patents don&rsquo;t grant you a right to practice the invention; rather, they grant you the right to stop others from practicing whatever the patent claims cover. So in some sense patents don&rsquo;t really serve the purposes of FOSS communities, since they don&rsquo;t directly guarantee freedom to operate. <br />
<br />
Another approach is to adopt a FOSS license that includes express patent terms. Among FOSS licenses, the General Public License Version 3.0 (GPL3) probably includes the most comprehensive terms meant to guard against the threat of software patents. I&rsquo;ve written about GPL3 and its patent terms <a target="_blank" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2143182">here</a>. Other well-known FOSS licenses, such as the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0, the Apache License Version 2.0, and the Eclipse Public License, also include varying degrees of patent protection in their terms. A significant limitation of this approach, however, is that no one is bound by the patent terms unless they use the software themselves and/or distribute it to others. Furthermore, in some FOSS licenses much of the patent protection only applies if the user modifies and distributes the FOSS to others. Even in the case of GPL3, the only patents impacted are those that read on the GPL3-licensed software (and derivative works thereof). Furthermore, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Open-Source-Alternative-Understanding-Opportunities/dp/0470194952">some evidence suggests</a> that companies and other potential users tend to avoid FOSS subject to licenses that include broad patent licenses such as that included in GPL3. So although the license approach may help in some circumstances, it may be cold comfort in many others.<br />
<br />
Which brings me back to the AIA, Linux Defenders, and the USPTO. True, the AIA fell short of software patent opponents&rsquo; ultimate desire to banish software patents altogether. But it did provide an enhanced avenue for FOSS communities to prove what they&rsquo;ve been claiming for years: that many software patents should not be granted. And, groups like Linux Defenders and projects like Peer-to-Patent are there to help FOSS communities make it happen. Other means, such as obtaining patents or releasing FOSS subject to a reciprocal patent license, have significant limitations in terms of applicability and practicability. And these means mimic the methods of proprietary software providers in any event. A more promising approach is to harness the strengths of FOSS communities: peer-to-peer collaboration. Indeed, ironically (or not), the key to addressing the risks of software patents may ultimately lie in the same spirit of collaboration that has served FOSS communities so well from the beginning.
