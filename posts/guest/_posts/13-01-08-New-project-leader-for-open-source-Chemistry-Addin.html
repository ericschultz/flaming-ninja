I am very pleased to have been asked to be the interim project leader for the <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/Galleries/ResearchAccelerators/ChemistryAddinforWord">Chemistry Add-in for Word</a> (often referred to as Chem4Word).  I&rsquo;m a research chemist by training who also has extensive experience of software development in scientific organisations.  I got involved with Chem4Word when I worked at <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fresearch.microsoft.com%2fen-us%2flabs%2fcambridge%2fdefault.aspx&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429" target="_blank">Microsoft Research </a>and got to meet the original team behind its inception and initial development. My new role can be seen as a natural progression of this work, but I have always been enthusiastic about &lsquo;democratising&rsquo; science.  Making scientific software available to anyone who wants to use it, and Chem4Word in particular, shows us one way we can achieve this goal.<br />
<br />
Also, Chem4Word is unusual among open source projects in that it has had an outstandingly high adoption among users from many communities, especially scientists and students of science.  I want this to continue;  I also want to see Chem4Word go from strength to strength and the best way for this to happen is for the user community to get involved in its development in all sorts of ways. <br />
<p>So, to help bring this about we need you, the users, to help with the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <strong>Bug identification and fixing:</strong>  if you can help us to track down bugs or, even better , help us to fix them then we can ensure that Chem4Word&rsquo;s quality continues to improve with age;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>New features: </strong> what new features would you like to see in Chem4Word?  What do you like and what don&rsquo;t you like?  If you have C# or Word programming skills, would you be prepared to help us to grow the product?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>User support: </strong> if you&rsquo;re an experienced Chem4Word  user, would you be prepared to help with support queries?  Would an open discussion forum be the best way of supporting our growing user base, or can you think of a better process for supporting this tool?</li>
</ul>
<br />
One thing is certain, Chem4Word will not progress and thrive without your input.  Everyone who has been involved with it up to now, especially at Microsoft, the Outercurve Foundation and the Cambridge University team, deserves a huge round of applause for making this seminal project possible, but its future is going to rest with its users in education, science, or just people with an interest in chemistry.  Looking at how many of us have downloaded it and used it, there should be plenty of interest in making sure that Chem4Word has a bright future.  Let&rsquo;s all do our bit to make this happen.<br />
