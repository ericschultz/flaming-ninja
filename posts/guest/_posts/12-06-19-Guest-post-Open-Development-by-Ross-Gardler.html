<h2>License + Governance = open development</h2>
Participants in a meritocratic open source project are usually described as volunteers. I discussed this recently when I asked "<a href="/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fblogs.computerworlduk.com%2fapache-asserts%2f2012%2f05%2fapache-openoffice-can-i-depend-on-software-built-by-volunteers%2findex.htm&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429" target="_blank" re_target="_blank">Can I depend on software built by volunteers</a>?" However, that post did not address issues of leadership. Whilst individual volunteers may receive payment to work on a project, that payment is often external to the community.&nbsp;
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Many people believe that external hierarchies of pay-scales should have no bearing on the management of community led open source projects. But if hierarchy is frowned upon, who do users and contributors turn to for management leadership? Who sets objectives and defines strategy?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>To answer these questions some projects have a paymaster who define a leadership group by virtue of their "ownership" of the project. This creates a situation in which an employer can control a "community" project. Whilst this addresses the questions of "who" needs to be trusted it brings with it additional questions of "why" they should be trusted.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Whilst there are examples of significant success using both models, there are many more examples of failure. What is it that makes some projects with clear leadership succeed and others fail? At the same time what prevents projects with no defined leadership from disintegrating in chaos?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Open source is more than a license</h2>
<p>The Open Source Initiative (OSI) describes open source as "a development method for software that harnesses the power of distributed peer review and transparency of process." Note that this definition does not reference licenses. Nobody will deny open source licenses, which the OSI approves, are vital. Without them we cannot guarantee the <a href="/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fwww.gnu.org%2fphilosophy%2ffree-sw.html&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429" target="_blank" re_target="_blank">four freedoms</a> nor can we conform to the OSI's <a href="/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fhttp%2f%2fwww.opensource.org%2fdocs%2fosd&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429" target="_blank" re_target="_blank">Open Source Definition</a>. However, there is more to open source than a license.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If we want to realise the full potential of open source as a development methodology we also need to consider "governance models", that is how a project is managed. A clear governance model ensures that all contributors understand how to engage, what is expected of them and what protections are provided for their status as a contributor. That is, it defines the rules of engagement and decision making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Open source licenses provides the legal framework within which parties collaborate. A governance model provides the social framework for that collaboration. A combination of open source license and a transparent governance are what makes open source software successful. So what is a good governance model? </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>People versus process</h2>
<p>A governance model need not be, indeed should not be, a complex document that attempts to cover every possible circumstance. It is a guidance document covering the most common community processes, nothing more. It should recognise that written rules can be both empowering and constraining. Rules make a process predictable and repeatable but they can also make a community resistant to change, or even blind to the need for change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The goal is to cover the basics of how decisions are made, what roles exist within the project, who can fill them and what privileges those roles afford. What we are trying to do is describe how the community will interact and provide a means for resolving any conflicts that might arise during the lifetime of the project. The goal is to create an environment in which people feel comfortable engaging with the project on a long term basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>People just want to be able to get work done in an efficient way. This is especially true of a community led open source project in which people are not paid by the project itself. A good governance model is therefore about enabling flexibility, empowering individuals to take ownership of specific items, and preventing (occasionally resolving) conflict.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>However, this in turn can present a problem. Many people find working in a self-directed, bottom-up, collaborative environment challenging. This is where leadership comes in. In an open source project leadership is not about directing it is about getting stuff done and <a href="/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fopensource.com%2fbusiness%2f11%2f2%2fleadership-open-source-communities&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429" target="_blank" re_target="_blank">empowering others</a> to get stuff done. This is true of projects with a paid leadership as well as those without. </p>
<p>
</p>

<h2>Learning to be a community leader</h2>
<p>Since leadership in open source is bottom-up while elsewhere it tends to be top-down it can be difficult to come to terms with. For this reason most open source foundations provide a mentoring programme of some kind. Sometimes it is formal, as is the case in the <a href="/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fincubator.apache.org%2fguides%2fmentor.html&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429" target="blank" re_target="blank">Apache Software Foundations Incubator</a> other times it is informal as is the case here in the <a href="/LinkClick.aspx?link=118&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429" target="blank" re_target="blank">Outercurve Foundation</a>. In all cases mentors are there to listen, guide, educate and provide insight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Good mentors bring experience of both successful and unsuccessful open source projects. They also bring a network that embodies different experiences. With this resource a project can seek to identify common approaches to specific issues as they emerge. These approaches can then be evaluated and adapted to suit local needs. </p>

<h2>Too many cooks? </h2>
<p>I started this piece by saying open source is more than a licence. I asserted that governance is also important. I then switched to talking about leadership in community projects. Ultimately I argued that everyone in a community led open source project is a leader. It is at this point that many people ask "if everyone is a leader what prevents a project from descending into anarchy?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Finding the right balance between bottom-up anarchy and top-down leadership is hard. This is where the governance model comes in. It provides the social scaffolding for collaboration. It empowers individuals who just want to get things done and it provides mechanisms by which community deadlocks can be broken.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In my next two posts I'll look at two extreme examples of common governance models, the "benevolent dictator" model in which one individual appears to have all the authority, and the "meritocratic" model where anyone with sufficient merit has equal authority. Once these two extremes are understood we'll discover that, when successful, they differ in only minor ways. </p>
