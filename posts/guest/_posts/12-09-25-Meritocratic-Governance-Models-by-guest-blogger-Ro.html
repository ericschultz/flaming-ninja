<h2>Introduction to Meritocracies</h2>
<br />
Newcomers to an open source project are presented with a number of opportunities for contribution. Many, such as user feedback and testing, do not require write access to the source code and can be enacted without special project rights. However, when it comes to submitting code contributions people normally work, at least in the first instance, through a group of "leaders" who control access to the projects decision making process and resources.<br />
<br />
In traditional "centralised" models of governance this gating of contributions becomes a bottleneck. A meritocracy recognises this and provides a defined mechanism by which individuals can earn direct influence over the project. This process is quite different to approaches within which employment status, experience or financial contributions might earn "power". In the meritocratic model anyone contributing in any positive way earns equal authority.<br />
<br />
This process of empowering those who contribute scales very well. Furthermore it minimises friction because it recognises power and influence as scarce resources. Newcomers are seen as volunteers that want to help, rather than people that want to grab a share of that scarce resource. A true meritocracy lacks artificial filters for contributions that are commonly found in other models. This lack of artificial filters ensures the broadest possible range of contributors. When managed well this process creates an environment in which everyone, regardless of their relationships outside of a project, can collaborate.<br />
<br />
<h2>Decision Making</h2>
<br />
A meritocracy is typically leaderless, that is, whoever is best equipped to lead in any specific situation will be the leader for that situation only. People lead through action, not authority, they don't have any more authority than any other participant. This often causes newcomers to meritocracy to assume that a project will inevitably grind to a halt since it will be unable to make decisions.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, in software development the vast majority of our decisions are easily reversible. As long as we identify mis-steps early we can roll back version control and it's as though it never happened. Consequently, most decisions in a software project are made through a process called "lazy consensus".<br />
<br />
In lazy consensus We lazily assume that anyone with sufficient merit to take action is going to do so with good intentions. We review all actions quickly and, if necessary raise, discuss and act upon any objections. In the unlikely event that consensus cannot be reached a conflict resolution process is enacted. In the vast majority of cases there is no need for discussion and no need to seek approval for actions.<br />
<br />
Potentially controversial actions may be brought to the communities attention for feedback and approval prior to work being carried out. This can reduce the number of "roll-backs" necessary since consensus is sought before work commences. Since those with merit have already demonstrated a sensitivity to when this is necessary there need not be hard rules in place to manage this, all that is needed is full transparency on all actions and their motivation.<br />
<br />
A meritocratic project can therefore proceed at a pace set by the community members willing and able to take action. It is therefore more efficient to recognise appropriate merit early so as to enable active contribution.<br />
<br />
<h2>Roles, responsibilities and delegation</h2>
A meritocracy does not have defined leaders and no concept of delegation. Everyone is equal. Everyone is a volunteer. Everyone gets the same rewards for contribution. Whilst someone may indicate that a task is awaiting a volunteer that task cannot be delegated. External relationships between contributors might result in delegation taking place outside of the community, but that power structure has no influence on the project itself.<br />
<br />
Whilst there are no project leaders there are certain traits that make people effective community leaders. Such people are key to the ongoing health of a meritocratic community and therefore the project itself. An ability to demonstrate how others might earn merit and then take a step back and see what happens is perhaps the best skill for a community leader to have since a healthy project community leads to a more viable open development model and thus to a more viable software output.<br />
<br />
<h2>Advantages and disadvantages</h2>
Perhaps the biggest advantage of a meritocracy is the flat project structure. Each individual has an equal say in the project. This means that those seeking to invest time and energy into a meritocratic project reduce the risk of the project taking a direction which is incompatible with their own objectives.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, whilst a true meritocracy is fully inclusive it is common for meritocracies to fail in the recognition and reward of merit. This can be for a number of reasons, for example defining what actions are worthy of merit or how much merit is needed for certain rights is difficult. Furthermore, applying the rules of merit evenly is also difficult.<br />
<br />
As a result of the difficulties in defining and recognising merit many meritocracies are, in reality, more like oligarchies, that is a structure in which power effectively rests with a small number of people. Those people use their energy and influence to create an artificial hierarchy that allows them to "mold" the definition of merit to suit their own needs. Whilst this model can work well it is not to be confused with a true meritocracy.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/murphy/apaches-open-source-governance-model/1196">Paul Murphy </a>observed this in a ZDNet article back in 2008:<br />
<br />
"Notice that what distinguishes the Apache foundation from thousands of other organizations isn't the idea that people should become what they can do, but their consistent execution on this idea - basically most organizations talk about devolving authority to the leading edge, but then weight the actual execution the other way to gradually centralize control. Apache, like the U.S. Military (and any well run Unix shop) weights its execution the other way: to actually put people on the cutting edge in charge."<br />
<br />
A further complication is the need to separate ones own priorities from those of the community. This is particularly difficult for larger vendors with significant investment in a project. A community led project is not driven by an external force, it is driven by a community which shuns power structures. Frustrations with the lack of ability to control any given set of objectives can also lead to the creation of an oligarchy rather than meritocracy.<br />
<br />
Finally, many of the practices found in meritocratic projects seem counter to common experience in centralised structures. For this reason the Apache Software Foundation created the Apache Incubator Project in 2002. Projects enter the ASF through the Incubator where they are assigned mentors. These mentors help ensure all projects operate in accordance with the Foundation's philosophy and guidelines for collaborative development before they "graduate" to become official Apache projects. Without the Incubator the foundation would not have had the same level of success replicating the model across its projects. Support such as this is not easily accessible outside the ASF.<br />
<br />
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<br />
In a previous post we discussed the <a href="/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2f%2fBlogs%2fEntryId%2f57%2fThe-Benevolent-Dictator-Governance-Model-Guest-Blogger-Ross-Gardler&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429">benevolent dictator governance model</a>. We observed that in most projects a benevolent dictator (BD) needs to delegate responsibility to others in order to avoid becoming a bottleneck for the project. We also saw how they need to listen to and respond to the demands of their community if they hope to maintain third party engagement. However, a BD project stands or falls on one individual.<br />
<br />
In this post we have discussed an alternative model in which the process of empowering the community is defined by the recognition of merit. The meritocratic process allows anyone to become a part of the project management team. It is, according to proponents, a friction free governance model that scales very well since the number of community leaders grows as the project grows.<br />
<br />
Both models are successfully employed in open source projects. When applied to community driven (as opposed to vendor driven) projects both models have the same objectives. Consequently it is possible to build an ideal model for your community project that draws on the advantages of both extremes discussed. Unfortunately, defining and operating the ideal model in your own project requires a deep understanding of all options available and the impact of each on the community. For this reason the Outercurve Foundation provides its projects with mentors who, collectively, have a deep understanding of successful (and sometimes unsuccessful) implementations of both the meritocratic and benevolent dictator models.
