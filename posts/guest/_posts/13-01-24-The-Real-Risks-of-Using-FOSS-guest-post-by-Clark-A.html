<p>Free and open source software (FOSS) has always presented a bit of a conundrum for companies wishing to use it. On the one hand, significant numbers of useful FOSS projects are freely available under license terms that grant users broad rights in the FOSS. On the other, FOSS is still subject to intellectual property (IP) rights, and FOSS generally doesn&rsquo;t come with any sort of backing from a third party. In fact, FOSS licenses almost universally disclaim any sort of IP warranty or indemnity.</p>
<p>Consequently, IP remedies such as injunctions and statutory damages under copyright law are available against those that do not respect FOSS license terms. And without any IP backing, users of FOSS are on their own in terms of addressing any IP risks associated with FOSS. So while the advantages of significant amounts of freely accessible software are enticing, the prospect of IP risks can quickly dampen the mood. In my experience, corporations&mdash;at least their lawyers&mdash;tend to over focus on this latter reality of the FOSS world, potential IP risks, when making FOSS use assessments. This focus tends to lead to overly conservative approaches to FOSS use that fail to properly take into account the first reality of the FOSS world mentioned above: that many useful FOSS projects are freely available and have been in use for some time, and that those contributing materials under generous FOSS license terms generally do so precisely because they want others to use them.</p>
<p>This second reality has several important implications for assessing the actual IP risks of using FOSS materials. First, those that make materials available under a FOSS license aren&rsquo;t generally very litigious because 1) the FOSS isn&rsquo;t what brings home the bacon (at least directly), and 2) FOSS owners have made the FOSS available precisely because they want it to be used as widely as possible. Unlike proprietary software vendors, who release software into the world in order to collect royalties for each copy, those that release FOSS into the world generally don&rsquo;t have direct economic purposes in mind. They certainly may have indirect economic purposes in releasing FOSS, e.g., Google with Android or Red Hat selling ancillary products and services. But the software itself is not a profit center per se. This reality in and of itself makes FOSS copyright owners less likely to bring litigation against users of the FOSS. Furthermore, FOSS projects generally want to encourage as wide of adoption of their particular project as possible (e.g., in order to promote their indirect economic purposes or simply because wide adoption brings with it status), and so are not apt to initiate enforcement activities, which would deter others from using the FOSS. Given these realities, the threats of statutory damages or an injunction are more theoretical than something that is likely to happen, except perhaps in an extreme, egregious case. </p>
<p>This is borne out by the fact that despite over two decades of significant FOSS use, very few FOSS lawsuits have materialized. The paucity of FOSS lawsuits is almost certainly not a product of near-perfect FOSS license compliance. Plenty of evidence suggests that FOSS license compliance is often rather weak; otherwise, Black Duck, Palamida, and other FOSS compliance shops would all be out of business. Instead, the strikingly low number of FOSS-related lawsuits is likely the product of the nature and purposes of FOSS communities themselves. This is not to say that copyright holders of FOSS don&rsquo;t care whether users respect their license terms, or that they won&rsquo;t bring suits for non-compliance. Many certainly do care, and some may bring actions against violators. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fwww.fsf.org%2f&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429">Free Software Foundation</a> and its allies in particular have been fairly active over the years in bringing actions against blatant violators of FOSS license terms. But it is to say that the nature of such actions is inherently different because of the nature of the FOSS world and the purposes behind releasing software as FOSS in the first place.</p>
<p>For instance, the FSF states that its purpose for enforcement activities is to bring license violators into compliance. It&rsquo;s not to shut down a product, or collect statutory damages under copyright law. Instead, depending on the applicable license, they merely want you to provide the required attribution or source code. And even before they commence an action, they will generally prompt the non-complying party (in some cases multiple times) to fix the non-compliance and give them a reasonable period to do so.What does this all say about FOSS use and IP remedies? Merely that the theoretical risks of IP remedies are often given undeserved prominence in assessments of whether or not to use FOSS. The FOSS project almost certainly won&rsquo;t sue you if you give a good faith effort at compliance. And even if they do sue you, they are not looking to shut you down or collect statutory damages. They merely want you to comply. And chances are that if you try to comply, even if it&rsquo;s not precisely how they interpret compliance (e.g., their view of what constitutes a derivative work under the GPL is broader than how you think of it), they&rsquo;ll leave you alone. Well-established industry understandings of what various FOSS licenses require, especially in the case of the copyleft requirement, can also help you avoid adopting a doomsday approach to FOSS. If you&rsquo;re blatantly ignoring clear license requirements and repeatedly so, though, that&rsquo;s another matter entirely.</p>
<p>This brings me to the second issue with using FOSS, namely, that no one is there to bail you out in case of a third-party IP action against you for your use of it. In my mind this is a thornier issue, but several mitigating factors should still be taken into account. First, if a project has been around for some time or is widely used, all without litigation or threats of litigation, it&rsquo;s probably OK to use. Some litigation activity probably would have resulted had there been third party rights in those materials, or if a third party was interested in protecting whatever rights it may have in the FOSS. Even FOSS projects that haven&rsquo;t experienced widespread adoption or are relatively new may not be as problematic as you might think. While there&rsquo;s always the possibility that such a project has been &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; from a third party, it seems pretty unlikely in most cases. Someone who steals the Mona Lisa is unlikely to auction it off on eBay and similarly, someone that has stolen some code from Microsoft is probably unlikely to host it on Github or Sourceforge for all the world to see (including Microsoft). If the FOSS is from some obscure source, that might be a different matter.</p>
<p>Of course, simply because some code wasn&rsquo;t directly stolen from a third party doesn&rsquo;t mean that third parties won&rsquo;t have claims against you for using it. Independent creation is no defense in the world of patents, for instance, and so plenty of third parties may have patents that read on various FOSS projects. Microsoft has claimed for years that it has patents that read on Linux and has, in fact, struck various licensing deals with distributors of Android-based products (which runs on the Linux OS) on the basis of such patents.In my mind, this is probably the most significant risk of FOSS use. But it&rsquo;s also a risk no matter what solution you adopt (i.e., Microsoft probably has patents reading on everything you do). True, if you go with a third party commercial solution, you may have some IP backing assuming you negotiate the contract with that third party to your advantage. But then you are paying that third party licensing fees both for the product and the protection, which may turn out to be an insurance policy you never end up needing. And you may have less leeway in what you can do with that software. </p>
<p>Furthermore, while the Microsoft/Linux/Android scenario may seem particularly scary, it is the exception more than the rule. Up until now, there simply hasn&rsquo;t been widespread litigation or threats of litigation against FOSS projects or users thereof (at least that have been widely publicized). Particularly in cases of internal use, where no evidence of your use of a FOSS project is even discernible, the threat of third party patent suits is negligible at best.To conclude, allowing the theoretical IP risks of FOSS use to dominate FOSS use assessments can lead to underuse of a valuable resource that is less risky than you might think. And such self-imposed limitations can waste time and resources as companies adopt alternative, suboptimal solutions. While some IP risk does exist, some of that risk exists no matter what type of solution you adopt, whether it be FOSS or proprietary. Good faith compliance with FOSS license requirements can obviate many of the risks, and being aware of the major FOSS enforcement activities (e.g., the Microsoft/Linux/Android situation) can help address many of the others. One of the real risks with FOSS, in short, is to forfeit its advantages for no good reason. </p>
