Big Data and data science are rapidly growing areas, and there are numerous applications of these disciplines in the very Enterprises where .NET developers practice their craft.&nbsp; Just as with conventional database development, data access and Business Intelligence, .NET developers should be in a position to attain expertise in the Big Data arena, or simply integrate Big Data functionality into their line-of business applications.<br />
<p>The problem is that the Big Data world has up to this point been technologically and culturally distinct from the Enterprise developer world.&nbsp; In fact, Big Data expertise has been more the province of Web-focused startups than enterprises and enterprise developers.</p>
One solution to this problem would the implementation of <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fhadoop.apache.org%2f&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429" target="_blank">Hadoop</a> -- probably the most prominent open source Big Data tool -- in a fashion suitable for the Windows and .NET worlds.&nbsp; As it happens, even though that&rsquo;s a bit tricky, vendor collaboration, and tools available through the Outercurve Foundation&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=114&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429">NuGet</a> infrastructure, are making this union rather seamless.<br />
<p><strong>Windows is Only Half the Battle</strong></p>
Microsoft has teamed with the <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fhortonworks.com%2f&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429" target="_blank">Hortonworks</a> -- a spinoff of the Hadoop team at Yahoo -- to bring Hadoop to Windows and Windows Azure.&nbsp; For now, the <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fdocs.hortonworks.com%2fHDPDocuments%2fHDP1%2fHDP-Win-1.1%2fbk_installing_hdp_for_windows%2fbk_installing_hdp_for_windows-20130225.pdf&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429" target="_blank">Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) for Windows,</a> currently in Beta, is the on-premise solution and <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fwww.windowsazure.com%2fen-us%2fmanage%2fservices%2fhdinsight%2f&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429" target="_blank">Windows Azure HDInsight</a> (based on the HDP codebase), currently in public preview, takes on the cloud.&nbsp; Before HDP and HDInsight came about, Hadoop ran almost exclusively on Linux.&nbsp; The Microsoft/Hortonworks collaboration has brought Windows into the Hadoop world, and vice-versa.<br />
<p>But another gap remains.&nbsp; Regardless of operating system, Hadoop and its add-ons are written in Java, and geared to Java developers.&nbsp; Hadoop&rsquo;s MapReduce engine is natively programmed in Java, as are its custom data readers and writers.&nbsp; So even on Windows, .NET developers won&rsquo;t find Hadoop immediately accessible.&nbsp; And while Hadoop MapReduce has a mechanism (called <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fhadoop.apache.org%2fdocs%2fr1.0.4%2fstreaming.html&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429" target="_blank">Streaming</a>) to run executables written in any language, those executables have to be developed in a somewhat primitive fashion, which only makes matters worse.</p>
<strong>SDK to the Rescue</strong><br />
For .NET developers, one answer to these problems would be to create a software developer&rsquo;s kit (SDK).&nbsp; The SDK would abstract away the rough edges of Hadoop Streaming, and bring the same native integration of MapReduce to C# that Java developers already enjoy.&nbsp; For extra credit, the SDK might include a LINQ (Language Integrated Query) provider for a Hadoop add-on, called <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fhive.apache.org%2f&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429" target="_blank">Hive</a>, that provides a SQL interface to data in Hadoop.<br />
<p>Microsoft addressed both of these wish list items, with the creation of the the open source <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fhadoopsdk.codeplex.com%2f&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429" target="_blank">.NET SDK For Hadoop</a>.&nbsp; And this SDK, as it turns out, consists of three NuGet packages: the Microsoft <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fnuget.org%2fpackages%2fMicrosoft.Hadoop.MapReduce&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429" target="_blank">.NET Map Reduce API For Hadoop</a>, Microsoft <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nuget.org%2fpackages%2fMicrosoft.Hadoop.Hive&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429" target="_blank">Linq to Hive</a> and the <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fhttp%2f%2fnuget.org%2fpackages%2fMicrosoft.Hadoop.WebClient%2f&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429" target="_blank">.NET API For Hadoop WebClient</a>.</p>
<p>These three NuGet packages make Hadoop development something a .NET developer can understand, and because NuGet packages are so easy to integrate into a project in Visual Studio, .NET developers don&rsquo;t have to jump through hoops to get started.&nbsp; Three install-package commands are all it takes to download the NuGet packages and start programming against the SDK.</p>
<p><strong>Open Horizon</strong></p>
<p>These NuGet packages should work against Hortonworks HDP for Windows as well as Windows Azure HDInsight.&nbsp; In fact, with some additional testing and debugging, these tools should work against most any Hadoop distribution out there, regardless of its OS platform.</p>
<p>This will go a long way toward bringing Hadoop into the Enterprise in a credible way.&nbsp; And without open source projects and NuGet package distribution technology, that adoption would likely be much slower, and Big Data expertise would remain elusive, to .NET developers, their employers, and their clients.</p>
