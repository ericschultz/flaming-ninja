We have been receiving a lot of feedback, especially from developers, asking questions like, &ldquo;How do you do while loops?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Can you make one event trigger multiple reactions?&rdquo; Another common question has been, &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we pass data from an event to a reaction?&rdquo;<br />
<br />
The short answer is that Mayhem is meant to be easy for everyone. This means you, me, developers, non-programmers, and even my grandmother should be able to navigate Mayhem with ease.<br />
<br />
But you didn&rsquo;t come to this blog for the short answer.<br />
<br />
The longer answer is split into two parts.  First, adding these things (loops, multiple reactions, data passing, etc) will make it more difficult for end users to use the program. Second, adding these things will make it more difficult for developers to write modules.  Both would defeat the purpose and vision of Mayhem.<br />
<br />
Mayhem approaches simplicity in a whole new way.<br />
<br />
For a  long time people have tried to simplify  programming for non-programmers by creating visual programming languages. However, none of these languages have seen widespread adoption by non-programmers.  Why? Even with graphical programming systems, you still fundamentally have to know how to program, or at least to think in terms of loops, functions, etc. How is my grandma going to be able to do that?<br />
<br />
With Mayhem we took a radically different approach in which we only support one simple, very generic construct. When something happens&hellip;do something else. That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s Mayhem. A lot of programmers have gotten frustrated with us because of this, throwing around comments like &ldquo;Mayhem isn&rsquo;t Turing complete&rdquo; and &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hopelessly limiting.&rdquo; However, Mayhem isn&rsquo;t designed to be a programming language; it wasn&rsquo;t developed to replace C# or any other &ldquo;real&rdquo; programming language.  Mayhem was designed to be the single link between Events and Reactions, with no programming required by the end user.<br />
<br />
While Mayhem can&rsquo;t do everything, what it can do is done trivially. Our model is one that everyone can understand quickly. We wanted to minimize the learning curve as much as possible;  adding  multiple constructs and parameter passing would make us no different than other visual programming languages. In other words, instead of enabling the language, we focus on enabling people.<br />
<br />
Okay, that explains why our super straightforward Event and Reaction model makes sense for end users, but why does removing all that functionality make it easier for developers? That&rsquo;s actually a pretty easy question. With Mayhem, we made every Event work with every other Reaction.<br />
<br />
Now imagine that we allowed the Event to pass data to the Reaction. Let&rsquo;s  pause for a second to talk about contracts in Windows 8. Contracts are my absolute favorite thing about Windows 8. (For more information on contracts, there&rsquo;s a great article here.<br />
<br />
As an example, let&rsquo;s say you wanted to take a picture from your hard drive and put it into a Word document&hellip; but the picture is only on Facebook!  By downloading the Facebook app and implementing the Win8 photo contract, any photos stored on Facebook would become available to you through the default Windows photo picker.  There&rsquo;s even a generic sharing contract, so you can &ldquo;share&rdquo; what  your current application has saved with any other application (as long as both have implemented the sharing contract.) In order to program those applications you have to write custom code for each of those contracts, the program needs to know how to search, share and many more&hellip;generically.<br />
<br />
Let&rsquo;s jump back into Mayhem land. Mayhem&rsquo;s Event and Reaction model is a contract at its simplest. Imagine we have the Reaction DoThingsWithStuff. If the Event was able to pass a parameter, DoThingsWithStuff would need to know how to interpret that parameter. It might be an image, it might be a website URL, and it might be a custom object. DoThingsWithStuff would only ever be able to work with the things it was programmed for, failing for everything else.<br />
<br />
There are also obvious consistency problems for the end user in the case that DoThingsWithStuff knows how to interpret multiple data types. The end user would have to know how DoThingsWithStuff acts based on which event they paired it with. Something that might seem extremely obvious to developers would make my non-computer savvy friend frustrated because his connection didn&rsquo;t work as he expected.<br />
<br />
Now let&rsquo;s take Mayhem as it is; we don&rsquo;t pass any data, and Events and Reactions are self-contained. Any Reaction will know how to work with every Event made previously and any produced in the future, regardless of what the Reaction does. The Reaction always works the same way, and therefore you can be a master of that Reaction as soon as you use it.<br />
<br />
Not only are Mayhem Events and Reactions simple to code, they are universal concepts. Almost anything can be plugged into this model. From the real to the virtual, the most disparate devices and services can all tie together in Mayhem. What&rsquo;s more, you don&rsquo;t have to be a Boy Scout (or a master developer) to do the tying.<br />
