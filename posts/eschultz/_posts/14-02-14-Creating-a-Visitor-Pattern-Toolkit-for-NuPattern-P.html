<p>Outercurve <a href="http://www.nupattern.org" target="blank">NuPattern</a> is one of our more abstract projects at Outercurve Foundation. NuPattern exists for automating the implementation and management of common patterns in programming via pattern toolkits. If you think that's a little vague, don't worry! Lots of people new to NuPattern often have trouble understanding what it's used for. I personally didn't know it as well as I liked either. Jezz Santos, the project leader for NuPattern, suggested I develop a pattern toolkit of my own and document the process. Since the best way to learn a tool is to use it, I readily agreed, and this set of blog entries is the result. </p> <p>After a quick review of patterns I could create a NuPattern toolkit for, I decided on the "visitor pattern." As one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns" target="blank">Gang of Four design patterns</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern" target="blank">visitor pattern</a> is used for "separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates" (The Wikipedia entry for Visitor Pattern provides an example). I've implemented this pattern before manually but I've always found it prone to user error particularly when adding a new node type. You need to remember to add an "Accept" method, put a new "Visit" method in your visitor interface and update all of the implementations of the visitor interface. No part of this implementation is difficult, it's just time-consuming and error-prone. Automating these manual programming tasks is exactly what NuPattern is made for. </p> <p>Over a few days, I created a NuPattern toolkit to automate managing the visitor pattern. The result is an example of a very basic toolkit. Before we get into how to create a NuPattern toolkit, I want to show you what using a toolkit is actually like. </p> <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hwakQw5iH-4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></span> </p> <p><span>I hope that this blog and tutorial gave you an idea of how NuPattern toolkits can help you. Next week, I'll discuss how the visitor pattern toolkit was constructed and how you can create your own!</p> <h1>Try the Visitor Pattern Toolkit </h1> <ul> <li>VSIX for Visual Studio 2013: <a href="https://github.com/ericschultz/visitor-pattern/releases/download/v1.0/VisitorPattern.vsix" target="blank">https://github.com/ericschultz/visitor-pattern/releases/download/v1.0/VisitorPattern.vsix</a></li> <li>Source code: <a href="https://github.com/ericschultz/visitor-pattern" target="blank">https://github.com/ericschultz/visitor-pattern</a></li> </ul>
