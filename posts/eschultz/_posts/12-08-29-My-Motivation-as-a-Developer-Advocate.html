<p>As Developer Advocate for the Outercurve Foundation, I think it&rsquo;s important for the community to understand my motivations for this position. In particular, I want to share how my interest in free, libre and open source software was developed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d always been taught that software development is something valuable, that one should be paid for development and that the results of that development should be restricted as much as possible. At the same time, I valued volunteering and improving the lives of others through whatever means I had. Despite my initial prejudice against giving away software, my interest in serving others encouraged me to continue researching open source software.</p>
<p> As the last decade moved along, I continued to run into problems with proprietary software that open source software solved. When I&rsquo;d find bugs in closed source software, I&rsquo;d report those bugs and then never hear when, or even if, the bug would be fixed by the vendor. I&rsquo;d see companies reimplementing libraries and not innovating because the original library hadn&rsquo;t been written in house. I&rsquo;d see bright young people all over the world unable to solve problems because they had no way of affording the tools they needed. As software licensing mechanisms became more restrictive, they prevented me from engaging in totally legitimate actions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I looked at open source, I didn&rsquo;t see roadblocks and ways to hamper users; I saw a landscape full of possibilities. When I found a problem in <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>,&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t wait for a company to evaluate whether the problem was important enough to fix it; I just fixed it. When I needed a library for a program, I didn&rsquo;t have to reimplement it; I just used it. While companies worried about how to protect their profit margins while serving the poor, the <a href="http://one.laptop.org/">One Laptop Per Child</a> project didn&rsquo;t have to worry about that; they just served. While proprietary software made me worry about how many PCs a copy of software was installed on, open source software asked nothing of me; I just installed it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To me, open source isn&rsquo;t just a set of tools or licenses, it&rsquo;s a positive example of our common humanity. Open source is meritocratic in that the most effective solutions are used and developed more and receive more attention. Open source is egalitarian in that even the best solutions are available to all regardless of income and wealth. Open source exemplifies the universal urge to leave the world a better place. Open source creates a community of individuals who appreciate curiosity and strive to solve problems for everyone&rsquo;s benefit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel my belief in open source is simple idealism though. Open source has created jobs, saved companies money, and been the foundation of billion dollar corporations. Fundamentally, the ability to create software in a rapid, cost-effective manner while serving the common good is why I believe in open source.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear how and why other people got involved in open source. Feel free to post them in the comments below, email me at <a href="mailto:eschultz@outercurve.org">eschultz@outercurve.org</a> or tweet me at <a href="https://twitter.com/EricOutercurve">@EricOutercurve</a>.</p>
