<p><em>Make sure to read <a href="/Blogs/EntryId/138/Creating-a-Visitor-Pattern-Toolkit-for-NuPattern-Part-1">part 1</a> and watch its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwakQw5iH-4">tutorial</a></em></p><p>My last blog entry and tutorial showed the basics of using my Visitor Pattern toolkit for Outercurve NuPattern. Let's move on to the basics of how a NuPattern toolkit is constructed using my example visitor pattern toolkit.</p><p>First we need to make sure to NuPattern installed in Visual Studio 2013. You can do this a few different ways:</p><ul><li>Inside Visual Studio go to the Tools menu, select "Extensions and Updates" and search for NuPattern </li><li>Download and run the NuPattern VSIX file from <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/332f060b-2352-41c9-b8dc-95d8ad21329b?SRC=VSIDE">Visual Studio Gallery online</a></li><li>Download and run the NuPattern VSIX file from NuPattern's website at <a href="http://www.nupattern.org">http://www.nupattern.org</a></li></ul><p>After completing the installation of NuPattern, you can clone or fork the Visitor Pattern solution code on <a href="https://github.com/ericschultz/visitor-pattern">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ericschultz/visitor-pattern/archive/v1.0.zip">download a ZIP</a> of the source. Open your copy of the solution and you'll be ready to follow along to the tutorials.</p><p>The first tutorial gives a quick overview of the NuPattern user interface, views and the pattern definition editor.</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lZmnkwZp0gM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>The second tutorial covers creating new elements in the pattern definition editor, variable properties, launch points, automation and how to build, debug and distribute your toolkit. That might sound like a lot, but the tutorial is only about five minutes long.</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OPOlr67snCk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Of course, Outercurve NuPattern can be used for a lot more than just building a simple visitor pattern toolkit. NuPattern toolkits can have a documentation pane in Visual Studio that updates along with the user's current action, perform automation when a particular type of item is dropped on the Solution Builder, multiple views, extension points so downstream users can extend your toolkit, a MUCH cleaner Visual Studio API and more. All those features may sound daunting but don't worry: if you ever get stuck, the NuPattern team is very friendly and always willing to help on their <a href="http://nupattern.codeplex.com/discussions">forums</a>.</p><p>NuPattern won't be the ideal solution to every development challenge, but if you want to automate tedious, error-prone tasks related to a pattern in Visual Studio, I think NuPattern is a great tool to use.</p>
