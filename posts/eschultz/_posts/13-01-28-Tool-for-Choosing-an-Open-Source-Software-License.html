<p>For many developers, choosing a free, libre, or open source software license is a daunting task. Unless you have an interest in copyright law and legalese, a developer can choose a license in one of a few ways. A developer can ask others what licenses they prefer. Grabbing a license from a project that a developer prefers is another way. The most dangerous way, and one of the most common, is to simply guess or even ignore licensing completely. Doing so may leave the developer open to legal action and prevent downstream participation in the project. </p><p>Guides are available to help a developer choose between general categories of license. Often these guides split licenses into a few general categories, i.e. more or less permissive. A more complete guide is Stephen Walli's recent blog post "<a href="/Blogs/EntryId/77/Which-Open-Source-Software-License-Should-I-Use">Which Open Source Software License Should I Use?</a>" Stephen goes beyond these minimal categories and considers such issues as patent licensing and litigation. Even in Stephen's case though, some important license characteristics aren't considered. Is the author's liability excluded? Are trademarks related to the software usable to an end user? Can a user sublicense the code to third parties? Guides don't often consider all these issues because they'd become too long to write or read. It really begs the question though, is there a simpler and more complete way to select a license? </p><p>Hints that such a tool may be possible come from <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a>. Shortly after launching, Creative Commons created a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/">tool</a> for selecting a license based upon a set of restrictions. Through progressive simplifications over time, there are now only three choices for a creator to make: whether to allow derivatives and whether those derivatives must be shared equally, whether to allow commercial uses of the work and which localized version of the license to use. Even though Creative Commons was based on the open source movement, a similar tool for open source licenses has been elusive though. One advantage that Creative Commons has is that they created all the licenses to make these simple decisions trees easy to create. In the open source world, countless organizations and individuals have created an open source licenses and each license has been created with specific scenarios and goals in mind. Even with this diversity, how-to guides and blog entries like Stephen's show there is a great deal of commonality between licenses. In the last week, I've stumbled on a tool that makes these decisions almost as easy as they are for Creative Commons.</p> <p><a href="http://www.tldrlegal.com/">TLDRLegal</a> simplifies licenses by allowing a developer to search (called a "reverse search") by the terms of the license they care about. Terms include whether a warranty is provided (Warranty), whether the original author can be held liable (Hold Liable), whether you must disclose the source code of any derivatives (Disclose Source) and more. These terms can also be used to search in a number of different ways including whether the license allows a particular term (CAN), requires the conditions of a particular term (MUST) or bans the conditions of a particular term (CANNOT).</p> <p>An actual example helps illustrate this process better. If you search for <a href="http://www.tldrlegal.com/search?stype=on&q=&c=%5B%7B%22title%22%3A%22Sublicense%22%2C%22type%22%3A1%7D%2C%7B%22title%22%3A%22Hold+Liable%22%2C%22type%22%3A2%7D%2C%7B%22title%22%3A%22Include+Copyright+Notice%22%2C%22type%22%3A3%7D%5D">CAN Sublicense, CANNOT Hold Liable and MUST Include Copyright Notice</a>, one of the licenses returned is the <a href="http://www.tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license">MIT License</a>. The MIT License's page summarizes what the terms of the license are, includes a summary of the terms in plain English, links to similar licenses and the full text of the license. These pages give a developer a simplified representation of the characteristics of a given license without requiring much legal expertise. TLDRLegal also has a search by license name function and a pretty slick <a href="http://www.tldrlegal.com/generate">Attribution Document Generator</a> to create an HTML document with the names, creators and license text of the open source software used as part of a product.</p> <p>Even though TLDRLegal is a great tool, it is not without room for improvement. Currently only a small subset of OSI approved licenses are included (but you're free to submit others!) and, most importantly, the vital issue of patent licensing and litigation is not addressed. Overall though, this site is a great step forward towards giving developers a tool to help them better understand the differences between licenses and choose the license which is best for them. It won't replace legal advice but if that's not feasible for your project or you'd just like a list of possible licenses to consider, TLDRLegal might fit your needs well.</p>
