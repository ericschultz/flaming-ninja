<p>Community is at the heart of free, libre and open source software development. While not a criteria in the <a href="http://opensource.org/osd">open source definition</a>, community is what sets open source software apart from proprietary solutions. With this in mind, I had the pleasure of attending the <a href="http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/">Community Leadership Summit</a> (CLS) for the first time this year. </p><p>Now in its 5<sup>th</sup> year, CLS brings together community managers and others who are interested in building and strengthening the communities they work in. Started by <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/">Jono Bacon</a>, an Outercurve mentor and Community Manager of the <a href="http://community.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> community, and scheduled to coincide with <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013">OSCON</a>, CLS brings in plenty of open source folks but that's not its sole audience. I'd estimate that a third to half of the participants are people who aren't involved in open source software. The fact that CLS is free to attend broadens the participant pool even more. A normal session might see an open source community manager who's sitting next to an employee of an international technical standards body who's sitting next to a manager at a local mental health charity. This diverse, melting pot of backgrounds leads to solutions to problems that might not be found otherwise. </p><p>As an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a>, CLS sessions are organized by participants once they've arrived. In many ways, this organization is a perfect example of community! A few of the sessions that I found particularly useful: </p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/rgardler">Ross Gardler</a>, an Outercurve mentor and <a href="http://apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a> President, led a session on <a href="http://communityleadershipsummit.wikia.com/wiki/Establisihing_the_Right_Image">Establishing the Right Image</a>. One particularly keen observation was that, even in meritocratic open source communities, a single individual personifies the project in people's minds. This personification is what a company would consider branding. In many ways this was an offshoot of a previous session on <a href="http://communityleadershipsummit.wikia.com/wiki/Branding_and_communities">Branding and Communities</a>. </li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/schtool">James Falkner</a>, Community Manager at <a href="http://www.liferay.com/">LifeRay</a>, organized a topic on <a href="http://communityleadershipsummit.wikia.com/wiki/Strategies_for_onboarding_new_developers">Strategies for Onboarding New Developers</a>. One of the more clever ideas mentioned was how <a href="http://www.neo4j.org/">Neo4J</a> handles code in documentation. Neo4J automatically creates unit tests for all of the sample code in their documentation. This prevents documentation from getting out of date when changes are made. </li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/dhedlund">Daniel Hedlund</a> organized a discussion on <a href="http://communityleadershipsummit.wikia.com/wiki/Micro-contributions">Micro-Contributions</a>, in this case referring to small sustained contributions to projects. One idea was to send a set of appropriate bugs to interested contributors every week and encourage them to fix one of them that week. I'm not sure if this has been done before although it sounds like it has a lot of potential. If someone knows of an application of this idea, I'd love to hear about the results! </li></ul><p>While I didn't attend OSCON, I heard from numerous participants that CLS is one of the most useful parts of their OSCON experience. I can't recommend this conference enough to anyone interested in building the community around their open source project.</p>
