<p>Over the past year, there's been a great deal of discussion about unlicensed code on GitHub. James Governor started the discussion by <a href="https://twitter.com/monkchips/status/247584170967175169">tweeting</a> that "younger devs today are about POSS - Post open source software." Our own Stephen Walli responded by <a href="/Blogs/EntryId/65/Open-Source-Software-Hygiene-and-STDs">comparing</a> code sharing without licensing to a "software transmitted disease." Aaron Williamson provided the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/04/18/github_licensing_study/">hard numbers</a> showing that only 14.9% of repositories on GitHub have a license. I've observed that many of the most vocal proponents of licensing have been non-developers or former developers involved in the open source software space. While these opinions are valid and important, active developers may view the problem differently. As an active developer I want to add a slightly different perspective on the dangers of releasing unlicensed software. My perspective is based on a simple phrase: "Your License Is Your Interface."
</p><p>As developers know, an interface is the formal description of how software interacts with users, including other software. Interfaces have two purposes, one obvious and one more subtle. The more obvious purpose is documenting the software's expected behavior. An example might be a function named 'GetId' returning the current web service user's identifier as a string. The more subtle purpose is actually a flipside of the first purpose: preventing unintended behavior. Using our previous example, our interface prevents access to the raw TCP and HTTP commands, the REST interface and any internal state information needed for the request. Through these two interlocking mechanisms, an interface creates a contract of expected behavior between users and the software.
</p><p>A license similarly defines the interaction between the software, or more precisely the creators of the software, and users. Just like an interface, a license defines intended behavior of users of the software, such as the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">four essential freedoms</a> or the <a href="http://opensource.org/osd">ten pillars</a> of the Open Source Definition. Just like an interface, a license prevents unintended behavior of users of the software, which depending on the open source license, may disclaim the original author of liability for use of the software, prohibit redistribution without recognizing the original author or prohibit distribution of derivatives under a more restrictive license. When it comes to legal use and distribution of your software, your license IS your interface.
</p><p>When you don't provide a license to published code, the consequences are similar to released software with an unclear interface. When an interface is vague or misleading, users guess at how they should use the software. In some cases, they guess correctly and they use the software in the way it was intended. In many other cases they guess incorrectly, causing pain and suffering for the user and complaints to the creator. When users guess at the allowed uses of your unlicensed software, sometimes they will use or distribute it in ways you approve. In many other cases, the user will use or distribute the software in ways you don't find appropriate. This is not simply an annoyance than can be disregarded. If you do not set a license on software, the law will set one for you. By default, the creator of the work is the only one allowed to use and distribute that work. In effect, your unlicensed software is an interface with no inputs or outputs, i.e. no interface; the user has no right to use or distribute the software. Licensing is the only way to provide the user with a legal interface to your software.
</p><p>I sincerely believe that most developers who have posted software on Github without a license actually want you to use their code for most purposes. Unfortunately, without a license you don't know that and by using the code, you could open yourself up to legal action. If you find a piece of useful software without a license, contact the original developer and ask them to license it. If you're a developer, make sure to license your publicly posted code. If you have questions about which licenses are open source, the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses">Open Source Initiative</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">Free Software Foundation</a> have a list of approved licenses to choose from. No matter the open source license you use, providing a clear license to your user is an important part of your software's user experience.
