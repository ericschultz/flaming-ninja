<p>Over the last few years the libre, free and open source software community has begun to recognize the lack of women and genderqueer folks involved in our projects. More than 98% of contributors to open source projects are men, and very few open source projects are not directed by men. From a purely technical point of view, this lack of diversity among viewpoints leads to lower-quality software. When everyone looking at a problem has been socialized with similar experiences, they're going to see a similar set of bugs and make similar design decisions. From an economic point of view, the lack of gender diversity in open source software is particularly insidious. In my opinion, participating in the development of open source software is one of the best ways to network with other people in the software industry. As a personal example, every job in my career to this point came directly from my work in open source communities. </p><p>As a Developer Advocate, expanding the Outercurve community, and the larger open source community as a whole, is part of my job. That's why I was excited when last week <a href="http://jamesgolick.com">James Golick</a> proposed a way for men in open source software to help fix this gender disparity. He offered spend up to half a day per week <a href="http://jamesgolick.com/2013/10/16/women-in-open-source.html">mentoring women</a> interested in participating in the open source community. <a href="https://twitter.com/paulcbetts">Paul Betts</a>, a developer at GitHub, jumped on board by <a href="http://log.paulbetts.org/mentoring-in-tech/">extending the same offer</a>. I'd like to make the same offer: <strong>I commit to spending a half-day per week mentoring women or genderqueer folks interested in contributing to an open source community</strong>. If you're interested in contributing to open source software, especially Outercurve projects, and would like advice or support please get ahold of me using the contact information below. </p><ul><li><strong>Email: -</strong> <a href="mailto:eschultz@outercurve.org">eschultz@outercurve.org</a> </li><li><strong>Skype: - </strong>ericschultzwi </li><li><strong>Twitter:</strong> - <a href="https://twitter.com/ericoutercurve">@EricOutercurve</a></li></ul>
