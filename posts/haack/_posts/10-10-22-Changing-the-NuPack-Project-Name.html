<p>We’re going to change the name of the NuPack project and we want your help!</p> <h2>Why is the name changing?</h2> <p>We want to avoid confusion with another software project that just happens to have the same name. This other project, <a href="http://nupack.org/" title="NUPACK nucleic acid package">NUPACK</a>, is a software suite by a group of researchers at Caltech having to do with analysis and design of nucleic acid systems.</p> <h2>Why was it even called NuPack?</h2> <p>When we started incubating this project, we developed it under the code name NPack. After merging with the Nu team, it seemed like a good idea to merge our names too and call it NuPack.</p> <p>At the time, we didn’t find any uses of the NuPack name in the same domain as our package manager.</p> <p>It’s not always easy to find a project name that’s not already in use by someone else. We’re trying our best though and definitely want to do what’s right.</p> <p>Fortunately, the Outercurve foundation has provided some helpful guidance in a blog post entitled:</p> <p><a href="/Blogs/EntryId/21/The-Naming-Game-Things-to-consider-when-naming-an-open-source-project" title="Things to consider when naming OSS">The Naming Game: Things to consider when naming an open source project<br /></a></p> <h2>What is the new name?</h2> <p>We don’t know. You tell us! The NuPack project team brainstormed a set of names and narrowed down the list to four names.</p> <p>I’ve posted a set of names as issues in our <a href="http://nupack.codeplex.com/">NuPack CodePlex.com site</a> and will ask you to vote for your favorite name among the lot. Vote for as many as you want, but realize that if you vote for all of them, you’ve just cancelled your vote.  <p>Here are the choices:</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href="http://nupack.codeplex.com/workitem/270">DotNetPack</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="http://nupack.codeplex.com/workitem/271">SnapFetch</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="http://nupack.codeplex.com/workitem/272">OuterPack</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="http://nupack.codeplex.com/workitem/273">NFetch</a></strong></li> </ul> <p>Voting will close at 10/26 at 11:59 PM.</p> <h2>I don’t like these choices. How did you come up with these?</h2> <p>Honestly, we would have really liked to have involved the community in brainstorming this initial set of names, but we wanted to avoid a goldmine for domain squatters. So we had a long brainstorming sessions among the project team and narrowed the list of choices using the following criteria:</p> <ul> <li>Domain name available</li> <li>No other project/product with a name similar to ours in the same field</li> <li>No outstanding trademarks on the name that we could find</li> </ul> <h2>Can I write in my own suggestion?</h2> <p>Unfortunately no. Again, we want to make sure we can secure the domains for our new project name, so we needed to start with a list that was actually attainable. If you really can’t bring yourself to pick even one, we won’t be offended if you abstain from voting. And don’t worry, the product will continue to function in the same way despite the name change.</p> <p>Also, give it some time. It may grow on you.</p> <p> </p>
