<p>It’s been a while since the Orchard Project reported on its doings. The Orchard Project was originally announced in November 2009 as a free, open source, community-focused project with the objective of delivering applications and reusable components on the ASP.NET platform. In this first wave, Orchard is delivering:</p> <ul> <li>A highly flexible and extensible CMS platform that aims to provide a great experience for developers, designers, and web professionals alike. <ul> <li>Developers can easily extend the Orchard with modules to add new behaviors and reusable parts to the site.</li> <li>Designers can create a highly customized look-and-feel using Orchard themes, which give precise control over the site’s markup, script, and CSS.</li> <li>Web professionals can efficiently build sites by assembling Orchard’s modules and themes, configuring their individual features, and defining new content types and items using the Orchard admin panel. Orchard also includes a number of simple site-building features, such as a basic blog, page and menu management, publishing and drafts, tags, comments, users, roles and permissions. Orchard is meant to run in either shared or dedicated hosting environments, and is also supported on the Windows Azure™ platform.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>At the Mix conference in March 2010 we debuted a Technical Preview release, which served to illustrate the project team’s approach to delivering a highly modular ASP.NET-based content management system with simple and approachable setup and customization experience.<br /><br />Next up, the team released a 0.5 version in August, laying the foundation for the Orchard module extensibility architecture and targeting .NET developers who want to extend the Orchard platform utilizing the various services of the Orchard framework.<br /><br />In addition to defining an experience for authoring, packaging, and sharing custom modules, the 0.5 release allowed site authors to define custom content types and extend their behavior with reusable “parts” exposed from the various modules in the system. We think this modular approach to content composition is quite powerful and unique in the .NET space, and bridges a gap that still exists in a lot of CMS systems.<br /><br />So now we’re ready for another milestone…<br /><br /><strong>Introducing Orchard 0.8</strong><br /><br />The Orchard Project team is pleased to announce the availability of the Orchard 0.8 release, which provides essential features that designers need to tailor the look-and-feel of Orchard sites. The release can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.orchardproject.net/download">http://www.orchardproject.net/download</a></p> <p>The Orchard 0.8 release includes a theme engine based on the new Razor syntax in ASP.NET MVC, which is an extensible object model for defining “shapes”, as well as a flexible template system for rendering those shapes. The theme engine includes support for multiple layouts and zones, a script and style sheet registration API, and more. It also includes a new default theme, “The Theme Machine”, which leverages these features and can be adapted to fit the needs of different site designs.<br /><br />As if a Theme Machine isn’t cool enough, the 0.8 release also includes support for widgets - in this case, configurable UI elements, such as a tag cloud or search input, which can be easily mapped to different regions in the site (for example, a sidebar). The configuration of individual widgets and the rules about where they appear in the site are configurable from the Orchard admin panel.<br /><br />For designers, this offers the flexibility to either brand individual sites or create reusable themes to be shared with others. Orchard 0.8 also includes support for packaging themes and publishing them to an online gallery feed where other users can discover and download them.<br /><br /><strong>The Road Ahead to V1<br /></strong><br />The Orchard 0.8 release marks the end of the second major milestone for the Orchard project, delivering a solid foundation for developers and designers to extend the CMS with modules and themes. With the 0.8 release out the door, the Orchard Team is turning its focus to the final wave of development leading to the V1 release.<br /><br />Development underway on the V1 release will deliver the essential features that Web professionals need for building and hosting real-world, production-ready sites. We expect to have a V1 release candidate before the end of this calendar year, and we are really excited to see what the community does with this open, flexible platform.<br /><br />Remaining work items include support for fundamentals such as shared hosting requirements and performance, usability improvements to the Orchard admin panel, refinements to the developer and designer APIs based on early-adopter feedback, and a handful of additional features for authoring and managing a site’s content, such as support for mapping lists of content items to the front-end and improvements to localizability.<br /><strong><br />The Orchard Gallery Project</strong><br /><br />Since the Orchard V1 release is all about extending the platform with community-authored modules and themes, we want to provide an easy way for developers and designers to share their work with the Orchard community-at-large. To serve that goal, we are beginning work on a new Orchard Gallery that will be a website for sharing Orchard module and theme extensions. We also realized our implementation of the module and theme sharing site using Orchard is a great reference implementation for how Orchard can be used, so we are publishing the Orchard-based implementation of our themes gallery itself. The project site is located at <a href="http://orchardgallery.codeplex.com/">http://orchardgallery.codeplex.com</a>,  and the code is available under the same New BSD license terms as the main Orchard Project.<br /><br />The implementation of the module and themes gallery will consist of a back-end system to store package information, a feed to expose its content to clients, and a front-end website (built using Orchard itself) for searching, browsing, rating, and submitting items.<br /><br />In addition to supporting the Orchard Project’s goals, we’d like to see the Orchard Gallery serve as a reference implementation that can be leveraged by other .NET solution providers for their own gallery and marketplace needs. Although development of the Orchard Gallery has just begun, we hope that delivering the gallery as an open source effort will spur participation from the .NET community to help define requirements and/or contribute to the implementation. For example, one of the ideas for the open source project is to drive agreement among partners on a conventional feed format, so that different gallery/marketplace websites supporting the format might benefit from common tooling experiences (i.e. to install extensions to applications). Some of the .NET solution providers who are already collaborating with Orchard to define the requirements for the project include Outercurve’s recently announced NuPack Project, Umbraco, Telerik, Axinom, and Screwturn Wiki.<br /><br />The initial goal for the project is to provide a basic gallery publishing implementation that can be leveraged by both Orchard and NuPack for their upcoming V1 offerings. NimblePros, LLC will provide professional services to manage the project and develop the initial implementation, along with accepting contributions from project stakeholders. Going forward (post-V1), we’ll look at additional scenarios to extend the Orchard-based gallery implementation for other applications. I invite anyone who is interested to contact us and get involved!<br /><strong><br />Where to learn more about the Orchard Project</strong><br /><br />If you’re a web developer, a designer or a web professional, don’t be a stranger to the Orchard Project.
