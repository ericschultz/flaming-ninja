<p>You know you are doing a poor job of explaining yourself when something that is  so obvious that you take it for granted is a complete revelation to someone  else.<br />
<br />
Last week the <a href="http://codeplex.org/">CodePlex Foundation</a>  (CPF)&#160;sent "ambassadors" (me and President Sam Ramji) to ApacheCon to  participate in one of open source's most significant annual events and to pay  our respects to the <a href="http://apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>  (ASF). 10 years is a great run, and the ASF&#160;has done some very impressive work  during that time, work that has certainly inspired us in planning the CPF.  Personally I&#160;give a lot of credit to Brian Behlendorf, who set the ASF&#160;on a  unique path from the beginning.<br />
<br />
In the early days of open source we all  thought of flagship open source projects as succeeding in part because of the  leadership of a single dominating individual. This tribal structure of a  "benevolent dictator", or at most a "council of elders", seemed to be the norm,  most clearly demonstrated in the case of Linux and Linus Torvalds. Unfortunately  this model does not replicate well. If you have to have another Linus to have  another Linux, then there isn't much you can do to facilitate that. You pretty  much have to wait to get lucky. Now, I&#160;think there are characteristics of open  source that make it easier to get lucky, but that's another topic.<br />
<br />
Brian  easily could have been the benevolent dictator of the Apache project. However,  he wanted something different. He wanted a process and an approach to project  governance that would liberate projects from their dependence on a single  individual, something scalable, and repeatable, that could incorporate and adapt  to changing best practices in open source software (OSS). Today we call this  "the Apache Way". It is an end to end process for the software development  lifecycle that any individual or company can adapt to. As we at the CPF&#160;try to  figure out how to facilitate corporate participation in OSS, we've learned a lot  from the Apache Way.<br />
<br />
So why is it so hard for people to understand what  the CPF is doing?&#160;Sam Ramji and I&#160;sat down with the folks from the ASF&#160;last week  to talk about our mission and some of our specific approaches for fulfilling  that mission. This led to their moment of revelation, and in turn  mine.<br />
<br />
At one point Greg Stein looked up and said -- you could almost see  the lightbulb going off over his head, "So the CodePlex Foundation could be  completely successful 5 or 10 years from now and have no intellectual property  of its own?" <br />
<br />
I&#160;thought about it. Now, I expect in 5 or 10 years the  CPF&#160;will have some intellectual property assets, but it seemed perfectly obvious  to me that that isn't a necessary condition for success. Why was it such a  revelation to Greg? I&#160;think the answer comes down to this:&#160;we're in early  stages, and have yet to have any projects affiliated with the CPF. We've only  recently released our first draft of the <a href="../../../../../docs/CPF_Project_Acceptance_and_Operation-DRAFT.pdf">project  guidelines</a>. So the legal documents we have posted so far talk primarily  about how code can be contributed or licensed to the CPF. To the casual  observer, that makes the CPF&#160;look like an intellectual property aggregator. And  sadly, that's almost the complete opposite of what we're actually  doing.<br />
<br />
I start with an undeniable basic premise: <em>Corporate software  developers under-participate in open source projects.</em><br />
<br />
What should we  do about that?&#160;Jim Zemlin of the Linux Foundation has <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/announcements/2009/08/linux-foundation-updates-study-linux-development-statistics-who-wri">talked  a lot</a>, over the years, about the importance of paid development driving OSS,  and increasing the number of OSS developers who are paid to work on  OSS&#160;projects. At the CPF&#160;we are focused on the complimentary approach:&#160;getting  more paid developers to do OSS&#160;development. So we are focused on a very  different end of the problem. We are looking at companies where code by default  is assumed to be proprietary, and it is assumed, by default, that the work of  software developers automatically belongs to their employer. As companies  recognize the need to increase participation in OSS, they recognize that they  must change these default behaviors. The problem is they have no well-defined  process for how to do so.<br />
<br />
Some of the issues have to do with software  development practices:&#160;how testing is done, how builds are managed, how  dependencies are tracked, how bugs are tracked, how releases are scheduled, how  security fixes are managed. All of this has to be adapted to new practices when  a project becomes OSS. Some of it has to do with cultural practices.  OSS&#160;developers simply have a different and more promiscuous notion about how to  share ideas and drive innovation. A lot of it has to do with intellectual  property:&#160;not just finding the right open source license, but finding the right  contribution agreement to get software out the door and the right release  agreement to enable developers to create software owned by someone other than  their employer.<br />
<br />
It can be a long turnpike from the point where a software  idea is conceived inside a corporation until the point where it reaches its  final destination as a released OSS project. Kudos to the ASF&#160;for trail-blazing  this path and thinking about the whole problem end to end. But by their own  admission, not every project is a fit for the ASF. They are a small, lean  organization (frankly, so are we). Their core expertise is in the community and  engineering side of OSS, and they do a great job of mentoring projects through  the Apache Way. But they cannot, at the same time, have the expertise to  accomodate a wide range of licenses or contribution agreements. They have one  license, and one contribution agreement that projects must adhere to. We have an  opportunity, at the CPF, to compliment the work of the ASF&#160;by focusing on the  early stages of this journey and what it takes to get a project out from behind  the corporate firewall. That means a more nuanced approach to contribution  agreements, and contenancing a wider range of OSS licenses. But all of this is  intended to make the CPF&#160;a <em>pass through</em> point. We are there to help  corporations find the right home for their OSS&#160;projects and their  OSS&#160;development work. <br />
<br />
If we are successful, projecs may start at the  CPF, but end up with the ASF, or some other organization. The key thing is to  get projects out "in the wild"&#160;in the open source community, while doing so in a  commercial-friendly manner. We are just a rest stop along the way, complimentary  to, and additive with other OSS&#160;organizations. That's the real answer to Greg  Stein's question, and that's how we aim to address the issue of  under-participation.</p>
