<p>What do NASA, the DOD, and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) have in common? A desire to embrace the open source development model, and a willingness to publicly expose their challenges to do so.&#160; In the past two weeks I attended two focused open source events: POSSCON and the NASA&#160;Open Source Summit. While the goals of the two events differed, there was a common theme: as much as data supports the ubiquity of free and open source software (FOSS), there remain large groups of IT professionals struggling to embrace FOSS within the walls of their organizations.</p>
<p><br />
<a href="http://posscon.org/" target="_blank">POSSCON</a>, which I would describe as a “boutique event,” evokes the same feelings in me as a boutique hotel: charming, big on service, full of character, and a delight to visit. The conference is strong because it is organized by a well-integrated group of passionate people who want to bring the gospel of FOSS to a small yet growing southern city (Columbia, SC.). The mayor (a transplant from NY) was a welcoming host and the organizers worked hard to bring marquis speakers to the event while keeping it inexpensive (I booked late, but at $99, felt I got great value.)</p>
<p><br />
In addition to the traditional conference speakers and exhibitors, the conference included a tour of the new <a href="http://www.gocesm.org/" target="_blank">IT-oLogy</a> facility and several BOFs. I sat in on the National Cancer Institute session, where a spirited group discussed the challenges an agency faces with FOSS. The NCI relies heavily on contractors to do their development work, and while the resulting work product is open source licensed (or public domain), there is little incentive to build out a robust community to enrich the work.</p>
<p><br />
The only sour note, which really cannot be attributed to the event organizers, was the drumbeat of abuse served on several high-profile sponsors. While it may feel good to throw a few spitballs at a perceived bully, it felt incompatible with the spirit of the event. I am no Pollyanna, but vendor-bashing as sport is growing tedious.</p>
<p><br />
The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/source/">NASA Open Source Summit</a>, organized by the <a target="_blank" href="http://open4m.org/projects/focus-forums/">Open Forum Foundation</a> was really more like a think tank than a conference. Peppered between presentations by government agencies and industry luminaries (DOD, NASA, IBM, RedHat, Mozilla, Github,) were breakout sessions where we work-shopped a very long list of issues that NASA is facing with regard to open source development. Some of the agency’s challenges are really quite similar to what large multi-national IT vendors have already addressed, with a twist of regulatory issues that impede their ability to just replicate the solutions that the vendors have applied. There was a lot of discussion about the NASA “vanity” license, NOSA, and overwhelming support for abandoning this license and sticking with an OSI license that developers are more likely to understand and embrace.</p>
<p><br />
Another thread linking the two events was the noticeable under-representation of women. It was recognized by the men in the audience (much tweeting about it) alas it is something I have grown accustomed to… am I becoming complacent?</p>
<p><br />
This week I am attending the <a href="http://thinktank.olliancegroup.com/" target="_blank">Open Source Think Tank</a>. I’ll be interested to hear from the state of California’s Lee Mossbrucker. Last year we work-shopped some of the challenges California was facing building an open source culture. I am curious what progress has been made and which suggestions had the most impact. Their issues sounded remarkably similar to those described by NASA, DOD, and the NCI. I also look forward to catching up with the women of open source; should be a bakers dozen.</p>
