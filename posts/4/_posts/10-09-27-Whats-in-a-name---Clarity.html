<p>Today we announced our new name, the Outercurve Foundation. I have talked to a number of people about the rebranding, and the two most frequent questions I am asked about this change are 1.) Does this mean you are distancing yourself from Microsoft? 2.) How did you pick Outercurve and what does it mean?<br />
<br />
First, I want to emphasize that this is simply a name change; we are not changing our mission. We will continue to focus on enabling the exchange of code and understanding among software companies and open source communities.<br />
<br />
Our primary reason for making this change is to reduce confusion between the nonprofit foundation, codeplex.org and the Microsoft forge, codeplex.com. Community members, journalists, you name it… have mixed up the two entities, and three months ago the board agreed that it was time to make the change. Since we are a relatively new organization, it was far easier for us to consider rebranding rather than ask the forge, which has used the name since 2006. And to be direct, no, we are not distancing ourselves from Microsoft; we are very pleased with our relationship with them and their continued support of the foundation. Their project leaders have been great to work with, and we are seeing continued interest in the projects and increased contribution and contributors.<br />
<br />
When we decided to change our name, we sought out a professional branding agency and hired <a href="http://www.protobrand.com" target="_blank">Protobrand </a>of Boston. They interviewed members of the staff, board, and board of advisors to narrow down those attributes that we wanted to convey in a name. After several iterations, we had short listed a handful of choices. We selected Outercurve in part because of the imagery it provoked.<br />
<br />
Outercurve Foundation was chosen as the new name because the word ‘outercurve’ conveys the idea of a continuum, while showing that we represent a broader constituency of software companies and developers that are now embracing open source. The name with the logo, show that we are bringing these broader communities together through a shared interest in innovation and growth.<br />
<br />
I would love to hint at some salacious back story here, ten years from now there may be some urban legend about the name, but truth be told, we did it the old fashioned way. And we are pleased with the outcome.</p>
