A lot of people in the open source community have asked me how the Microsoft Open Technologies, Inc., <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fblogs.msdn.com%2fb%2finteroperability%2farchive%2f2012%2f04%2f12%2fannouncing-one-more-way-microsoft-will-engage-with-the-open-source-and-standards-communities.aspx&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=429" target="_blank">announcement</a> impacts the Outercurve Foundation.   Outercurve has made tremendous progress in the past several years.  Jean Paoli and his team have been very supportive of our work, and I don&rsquo;t expect that to change.
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What I do anticipate is even greater awareness of the work we do within Microsoft and beyond Microsoft, in the broader open source community.   In just over two years, we have accepted 25 diverse projects into the foundation.   Many of these projects have come from Microsoft teams across the company, and many others have come from Windows developers and academic institutions leveraging the open source development model to create new projects that run on or interact with the Windows ecosystem.   Before the foundation was formed, there was no license, forge, and technology neutral place for these developers to go for the type of support a non-profit foundation like Outercurve offers to OSS projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, we now have over 250 contributors providing code updates and engaging in project activities. Well over 50% of Outercurve contributors are not employed by Microsoft, exemplifying the benefit of having a neutral place to collaborate.</p>
<p>Our four project galleries offer a diversity of themes, while providing a consistent and strong level of support to projects and their contributors.   <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=89&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=431">ASP.NET</a> is a technology-based gallery; <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=94&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=431">DLSI</a> serves projects aimed at solving interoperability challenges; <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=115&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=431">Research Accelerators</a> addresses the needs of the research community, and our newest <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=159&amp;tabid=87&amp;mid=431">Innovators</a> gallery embraces emerging technologies and innovation.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our pipeline is strong, and we are investing in new programs and staff.  In fact, we&rsquo;re currently on the hunt for a <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/Blogs/EntryId/49/Looking-for-a-Community-Evangelist">community evangelist</a>.   Please let us know if you have any good candidates to recommend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited about more growth coming this year with new projects, committers, industry partners, and our continued collaboration with Microsoft and Microsoft Open Technologies, Inc.</p>
