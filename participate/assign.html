<p>Assigning a project to the Outercurve Foundation provides a number of key benefits. The Foundation acts as a neutral not-for-profit third party encouraging contributions. The IP management practices provided through the Foundation can encourage others to adopt the project. The Foundation also provides a number of other services for the project.&nbsp; Learn more about project services.</p>
<p>While gallery managers are always on the look-out for projects that fit their gallery theme, anyone can submit a proposed project to the Foundation. The process starts with a proposal. Fill out the first page of the Project Proposal form and submit it according to the <a href="/About/ProjectProposal">procedures on proposing projects</a> to the Foundation. Suggest the gallery you believe your project best fits. If the project does not obviously fit into a specific Outercurve gallery, you can still submit your proposal.&nbsp; There may be ways of accommodating the project.</p>
<p>The Foundation will contact you through one of the gallery managers and work with you to complete the project acceptance criteria.&nbsp; The completed form will be submitted to the Board of Directors for review and discussion. The Board can raise a number of questions about the project, but the gallery manager ultimately has the ability to decide on a project.</p>
<p>We understand that choosing to join the Foundation will be a big decision for open source communities and the projects that they represent. All projects that join the Foundation will benefit from the shared resources available to the projects. The Foundation is building a collection of services and best practices from all of the participating projects and providing administrative and infrastructure support to projects and their communities.</p>
<p>A recent project, MVC Contrib, was assigned to the Foundation so that one company did not have to take on the burden of maintaining the IP management of the project, and by assigning the IP to the Foundation other contributors were more willing to participate. Eric Hexter, the project lead provides a full accounting of why they chose to assign the project <a href="/Blogs/EntryId/14/An-interview-with-Eric-Hexter-MVC-Contrib-Project-Leader">in a recent interview</a>.</p>
