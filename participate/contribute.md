The Foundation projects are organized under four Galleries:

ASP.NET Open Source Gallery

Systems Infrastructure and Integration gallery (SIIG)

Research Accelerators Gallery
Innovators Gallery

You may find an Outercurve project that is addressing a technology challenge that is important to you. Projects are only as strong as their community and our project leaders welcome new contributors to their projects. Each project has the flexibility to create its own web site, determine the open source software license that applies to the project, and which forge will host the code.

To contribute, simply navigate to the project home page and contact the project leader. The Foundation has acted to minimize the bureaucracy, and allow the project leaders to establish the project management style that fits their project. You will need to sign a contribution agreement for significant contributions, but all of your interaction to get started can happen directly through the projectâ€™s web site.

If you have any further questions, please contact the Outercurve Foundation directly.
