<p>The Foundation allows a company to sponsor a gallery to create community and collaboratively developed open source software projects. The Foundation provides the IP management process to demonstrate and maintain a clear provenance of the software, provides an armâ€™s-length liability firewall between the project and the core business, and encourages a community to form by not tightly holding the software property ownership.</p>
<p>Our investment in the infrastructure, IP Process management, and project services offers a cost effective, turn-key approach to any vendor wishing to build out a gallery of open source software projects centered on a theme of benefit to the sponsor. The strategic oversight of the gallery is the responsibility of the sponsor-appointed gallery manager, and the Foundation manages the administrative and logistical affairs. Because we are license, technology, and forge agnostic, we offer a flexible way for companies to nurture a set of open source projects and communities without forming their own foundation.</p>
