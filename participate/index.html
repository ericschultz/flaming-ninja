There are quite a few ways to participate in Outercurve

<h3><a href="contribute.html">Participate in a Project</a></h3>
<p>You may find an Outercurve project that is addressing a technology challenge that is important to you. Projects are only as strong as their community and our project leaders welcome new contributors to their projects. Each project has the flexibility to create its own web site, determine the open source software license that applies to the project, and which forge will host the code</p>

<h3><a href="project_proposals.html">Propose a Project</a></h3>
<p>Assigning a project to the Outercurve Foundation provides a number of key benefits. The Foundation acts as a neutral not-for-profit third party  encouraging contributions. The IP management practices provided through the  Foundation can encourage others to adopt the project. The Foundation also provides marketing and communications services for the project to help get the  word out.</p>

<h3><a href="gallery_sponsor.html">Sponsor a Gallery</a></h3>
<p>The Foundation allows a company to sponsor a gallery to create community and collaboratively developed open source software projects. The Foundation provides the IP management process to demonstrate and maintain a clear provenance of the software, provides an arm’s-length liability firewall between the project and the core business, and encourages a community to form by not tightly holding the software property ownership.</p>

<h3><a href="corporate_sponsor.html">Become a Corporate Sponsor</a></h3>
<p>A Corporate Sponsor enjoys all the membership privileges of a Gallery Sponsor, and in addition, is eligible to serve on the Foundation’s Board of Directors. Serving on the Board allows a Sponsor the ability to impact the strategic direction of the Foundation and provide oversight and mentorship to the Foundation staff, gallery, and project leaders. Advantages of corporate sponsorship are that you are enjoying of all of the inherent benefits of a non-profit open source foundation without having to incur the startup and operational costs of establishing your own. Serving on the Board of Directors ensures that you have oversight without the burden of operational management.</p>
