<h1>The Outercurve Foundation Project Acceptance Process</h1>
<p>Assigning a project to the Outercurve Foundation provides a number of key benefits. The Foundation acts as a neutral not-for-profit third party  encouraging contributions. The IP management practices provided through the  Foundation can encourage others to adopt the project. The Foundation also provides marketing and communications services for the project to help get the  word out.</p>
<p>The Outercurve Foundation provides a general framework for projects based on  the following principles:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Open Source Licensed:</strong> The Foundation accepts  community-based collaborative projects licensed using any <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category">Open Source Initiative approved license</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Community Developed:</strong> The Foundation <a href="/About/DevelopmentPractices">software development  and project management practices</a> exist to support good software IP  management and to foster a growing community without being tied to particular  tools or forges.</li>
    <li><strong>Technology Agnostic:</strong> The Outercurve Foundation is not tied  to a particular technology base and is an efficient and effective way for a  software collaborative community or organization to capture the legal benefits  and experience of a foundation without starting one from scratch.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating a Project</h2>
<p>The Foundation project creation process starts with a proposal. It's a simple  three step process.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Download the Outercurve Foundation Project Proposal (<a href="{{BASE_PATH}}/assets/files/OutercurveProjectApplicationForm-20110221.docx">DOCX</a>).</li>
    <li>Fill out the first page of the proposal per the following instructions.</li>
    <li>Send it to <a href="mailto:projects@outercurve.org">projects@outercurve.org</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Foundation will assign a proposal mentor to the project that will contact  the proposer and work with them to complete the Extended Project Acceptance  Criteria on the proposal. The completed proposal form will be submitted to the  appropriate Outercurve Foundation Gallery Manager for approval and then to the  Board of Directors for review and acceptance of the project into the Foundation.</p>
<h3>Filling out the beginning of the Project Proposal Form</h3>
<p>The following information is required on the Outercurve Foundation Project  Proposal Form to start the process:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Short description:</strong> The abstract. What's the one or two  sentence paragraph that sums up the project.</li>
    <li><strong>Long description:</strong> The longer description. This section  provides more in depth information about the project, its history, context, and  background.</li>
    <li><strong>License:</strong> What <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category">OSI approved license(s)</a>  will the project use for outbound license.</li>
    <li><strong>URL: </strong>The project URL(s)</li>
    <li><strong>Submitter:</strong> Submitter name, email, and affiliation.</li>
    <li><strong>Project contact:</strong> If different from submitter (name, email,  affiliation).</li>
    <li><strong>Project Mentor:</strong> Assigned by the Foundation.</li>
    <li><strong>Committers:</strong> List the name, email, and affiliation of at  least three committers on the project.</li>
    <li><strong>Proposed Gallery:</strong> Where does the project naturally fit  within the gallery structure of the Foundation.</li>
</ul>
<p>A proposal mentor will be assigned by the Foundation. It may be the gallery  manager for a project which is being encouraged by a gallery manager or that is  requested to fit into a particular gallery. It may also be a board member, staff  or a Foundation advisor.</p>
<h3>Filling out the Extended Project Acceptance Criteria</h3>
<p>The mentor will contact the project submitter and together they will collect  further information about the project for presentation to the Foundation Board.  This information includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Initial Goals:</strong> A brief statement of the project's initial  goals under the Foundation.</li>
    <li><strong>Background:</strong> Project history and background. When was it  started? By whom? Is there a product or research basis to the work.</li>
    <li><strong>Project Alignment:</strong> Why this gallery? Does the project align  particularly well with other Foundation projects? Other external projects?  Overlap with others? Take a novel approach compared to similar projects?</li>
    <li><strong>Open Source Experience:</strong> What open source community  experience do the initial committers and project leader have?</li>
    <li><strong>Naming Check:</strong> Project name check against search engines and  the USPTO.</li>
    <li><strong>Project Committer Management:</strong> While the Foundation does not  dictate how a project runs its community, or how new committers are promoted,  the Foundation does want to understand the basic ideas the initial project lead  and committers are going to use to manage their project.</li>
    <li><strong>Community Development:</strong> What does the project hope to  accomplish with it's community? How do they plan on  developing/growing/encouraging the community? Are there specific services they  will need from the Foundation (e.g. IRC channel)?</li>
    <li><strong>Development Plan:</strong> Forge and URL? Code repository and URL?  Bug tracking tools and URL? Will the project require code-signing services?</li>
    <li><strong>Initial Source:</strong> From where does the initial code originate?  Code history? Are there multiple code bases coming together?</li>
    <li><strong>IP Plan:</strong> Does the project plan to use assignment or license  agreements from contributors? Discuss. If the project is being bootstrapped from  multiple outside entities, what's the plan to merge them together under the  project's banner?</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Issues:</strong> Are there known legal concerns or issues? For  example, does the project implement a standard that may make IP demands?</li>
    <li><strong>External Dependencies:</strong> Does the project depend upon other  open source software projects outside of its own code base? Are the licenses  compatible?</li>
    <li><strong>Cryptographic Issues:</strong> Does the code involve any crypto  issues directly or indirectly that will require the Foundation to take steps on  behalf of the project?</li>
    <li><strong>Known Risks: </strong>Are there issues that need consideration? It  doesn't mean that a project with "known risks" isn't acceptable so much as it  demonstrates the people proposing the project understand how the project impacts  the larger world. For example a reasonable "risk" is that the participants have  no real open source experience. Discussion here means a stronger mentor may need  to be involved by the Foundation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This information gives the Foundation Board a strong feeling for the initial  project community and their experience, how the project meets the goals of the  Foundation, and how strong a mentor the project may need to help them succeed.  It also assures the Board, Gallery Managers, and Sponsors that the IP management  process is properly in place and the project is organized to support it.</p>
<p>The information will be circulated to the Foundation Board that will vote to  accept the project. If the vote is successful, the Foundation staff will  identify and assign a full time mentor to the project.</p>
<h2>Once a Project is Accepted by the Foundation</h2>
<p>Once the Outercurve Foundation accepts a project, the project leader, project  mentor and gallery manager work together with Foundation staff to move the  project into the Foundation. This happens through several concurrent tasks, some  of which may begin during the acceptance process:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Initial IP Assignment:</strong> The project manager starts the  process to get the initial assignment agreements for the project software IP  signed by the appropriate IP holders. Foundation staff and legal counsel help  with the process. Please see <a href="../../../../../About/DevelopmentPractices#agreements">Assignment  Agreements and Contribution License Agreements</a> for a discussion about  Foundation assignment agreements.</li>
    <li><strong>Contribution Agreements:</strong> The Foundation office works with  the project manager to get contribution agreements from initial committers in  place. Please see <a href="../../../../../About/DevelopmentPractices#agreements">Assignment  Agreements and Contribution License Agreements</a> for a discussion about  Foundation contribution agreements.</li>
    <li><strong>The Communications Plan:</strong> The Foundation office works with  the project manager to put a communications plan in place to announce the  acceptance of the project and encourage community engagement.</li>
    <li><strong>Services Plan:</strong> The Foundation staff work with the project  manager to organize any Foundation services the project will want to take  advantage of (e.g. code signing).</li>
